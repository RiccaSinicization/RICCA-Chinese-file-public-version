Chapter 2    The Kidnapped Maiden=第 2 章    被绑架的少女
Its movements are slow...but be careful. It's far more durable than other monsters you've fought. Even as a holy knight, you'll suffer a lot of damage if its large arms destroy your armor.=它的动作很慢...但要小心。它比你遇到过的其他怪物更耐揍。即使成为圣骑士, 如果它巨大的手臂摧毁了汝之盔甲，你会大残。

Mountain Valley Trail=山谷小径
A monster...! But they usually don't come out in daylight...!=怪物...！但它们通常白天不会出来...！
I feel an evil presence from this direction... Maybe the goblin leader who escaped sent them this way.=我从此方向感觉到邪恶的存在...也许是逃跑的哥布林首领把他们送到这里来的。
That direction is the same as the path that leads to the foot of the mountain. Maybe those goblins did attack the settlement there too...=这个方向与通往山脚的路径相同。也许那些哥布林也袭击了那里的定居点...
If we go to where there are more monsters, we might be able to catch up to the goblins who attacked your village.=如果我们去有更多怪物的地方，我们也许能赶上攻击你村庄的哥布林。

For what?=谢我什么？
You know... For saving me from the goblins...and helping me look for my sister...=你懂的...救我脱离哥布林...帮我找我姐姐...
The goblins...? My head was fuzzy when I gave you your powers, so I don't remember it well...=哥布林...？我给你力量的时候，我的头晕乎乎的，我记不清了...
But God sent me to deliver the brooch to the holy knight and help her carry out her duty. I'm just fulfilling my mission.=但上帝派我把胸针交给圣骑士，帮助她履行职责。我只是在完成我的使命。
I see... That reminds me, I have something I wanted to ask you...=嗯嗯...啊对，我有件事想问你...
What is this transformation...? And what do you mean, "duty"...? I look like a knight out of a fairy tale...=这是什么变身...？你说的“职责”是什么意思...？我看起来像童话里的骑士...

Don't ask me. I don't know either.=别问我。我也不知道。
But you look exactly like what God described, and you did receive his powers and became a knight, so there should be no problem.=但你看起来和上帝描述的一模一样，你确实获得了他的力量，成为了一名骑士，所以应该没有问题。
Yup.=哦哦。
But me...? I'm supposed to fight monsters and save people...? I can't...=但我...？我应该去和怪物战斗，拯救人类...？我不能...
True, you do look like any other human girl...but if God chose you, things should go just fine.=没错，你看起来和其他人类女孩一样...但如果上帝选择了你，一切都会好起来的。
<b>Beware of chasms!</b>\r\n If you fall into any of the various holes scattering the land,\r\n your HP will be reduced to 0.\r\n Be sure to jump over them.=<b>当心裂缝！</b>\r\n 如果你掉进遍布在地面的裂缝，\n你的HP将减少到零。\n一定要跳过它们。
God chose me...? Why me...?=上帝选择了我...？为什么是我...？
Eep! A giant caterpillar!? Ugh, it's squirming...=咿咿！一只巨大的毛毛虫！？呃，它在蠕动...
It's a hell beetle. They're insects that've turned into monsters. Their larvae spit out threads, and the fully grown ones attack from the air, so be careful.=这是一只地狱甲虫。它们是变成怪物的昆虫。它们的幼虫吐出丝线，而成年的幼虫则从空中攻击，所以要小心。
<b>Fire Sword Crystal</b>\r\n Collecting a fire sword crystal\r\n will infuse your weapon with the power of fire for a short time.\r\n You can deal periodic burn damage to weak enemies\r\n and deal massive damage to undead\r\n and other enemies with a low body temperature.=<b>火剑水晶</b>\r\n 收集火剑水晶\n将在短时间内给你的武器注火。\n可以对弱小的敌人造成周期性的燃烧伤害\n对不死生物等低体温的敌人\n造成巨大伤害。

Upon defeat\r\n"Kidnapped by highwaymen" \r\nH scene (Already seen)=战败时\n“被强盗绑架”\nH场景（已经看过）
All the plants have withered... The atmosphere is so eerie... This place wasn't like this the last time I came this way...=所有的植物都枯萎了...气氛太诡异了...上次我来的时候这里不是这样的...
A big red gem...! It looks like a Magic Stone, but...=一颗巨大的红色宝石...！像收集的那种魔法石，但是...
It's shiny and pretty, but something feels off about it... I didn't see anything like this when I passed by this place a while ago...=它又亮又漂亮，但感觉有些不对劲...我前段时间路过这个地方来着，没有看到这样的东西...
That's a Drain Crystal. It's a magic tool that accumulates and transfers magic energy. I suspected there was one nearby...=这是个导能水晶，积累和传递魔法能量的魔导品。我怀疑附近有一个...
This crystal is absorbing the magic of this land and transferring it somewhere else. On top of that, it's transforming some of the magic into a wave of evil energy that attracts and empowers monsters.=这颗水晶正在吸收这片土地的魔力，并将其转移到他处。除此之外，它还将一些魔力转化为邪恶能量波，吸引怪物并赋予其力量。
So that's why the monsters have been restless lately... And the plants around here are withered because the crystal took their energy...=怪不得怪物们最近一直焦躁不安...这附近的植物都枯萎了，因为水晶吸走了它们的能量...
Exactly; this is the root cause. If we don't get rid of this, the whole mountain will become withered and overrun by monsters.=确实。这是根本原因。如果我们不把它除掉，整座山都会枯萎，怪物就会泛滥成灾。
No... That's awful... Who would put this here...?=不...太屑了...谁会把这个放在这里...？
It's probably the work of Archlich. I'm sure the absorbed magic is sent to him, too.=这可能是阿奎雷奇的好活。我相信吸取的魔力也会送到他那里。
Ark-Rich...? The goblins said something about him, too...=大...尸巫...？哥布林们也提到了他...
I'll explain more later. Let's just break the Drain Crystal first. Then the monsters will gradually disappear and the mountain will return to its original state.=我以后再解释。让我们先打破导能水晶，然后怪物会逐渐消失，山也会回到原来的状态。
Okay, I got it.=好的，我明白了。
There might be more Drain Crystals along the way. Let's break any that we come across.=前路可能还有更多导能水晶。打破就完事儿啦。
Crystals that attract monsters... Who would do such a thing...?=吸引怪物的水晶...谁会做这样的事...？
This is the work of Archlich, the wicked necromancer.=这是邪恶的亡灵巫师，阿奎雷奇的作品。
Archlich...?=阿奎雷奇...？
He's an evil wizard who once manipulated monsters to ravage the world. The legendary holy knight was the one who defeated him.=他是一个邪恶的巫师，曾经操纵怪物来蹂躏世界。传奇人物圣骑士就是那个打败他的人。
I think I remember a fairy tale about that... But that wizard was defeated, right? So why...?=我记得这个童话故事...但那个巫师被打败了，对吗？那为什么...？
It seems that he has resurrected. Necromancy is magic that came from researching ways to obtain immortality, so he must have used that power.=他似乎复活了。巫术是一种来自于研究不朽的途中道法，他一定使用了这种力量。
God needed someone to defeat the evil wizard, and chose to bestow you with the power, and the duty.=上帝需要有人来击败邪恶的巫师，并选择赋予你力量和责任。
God...chose me...? Why...?=上帝选择了我...？为什么？
Like I said, I don't know either. But you want to defeat monsters and save mankind, right?=我说过，我也不知道。但你想打败怪物拯救人类，对吗？
(<indent%3D0.4em>Save mankind...? Right, I'm going to save everyone... Including Miria...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>拯救人类...？好吧，我要拯救所有人...包括...姐姐在内...)
What's wrong? Let's get going.=咋地了？我们走吧。
Um... Uh... Miss Fairy... What's your name...? I-If I may ask...=嗯...呃...妖精小姐...你叫什么名字...？请允许我问一下...
Name...? Well, God gave me the name "Iris" when I became his servant...=名字...？当我成为上帝的仆人时，我得到了“Iris“这个名字...
You don't have to be uptight around me. I don't want to see you get all awkward.=你没必要在我面前这么紧张。我不想看到你尴尬的样子。
Th-Thank you very... I mean, okay. Then I'll be calling you Iris from now on. Teehee...=非，非常感谢你...好吧。那我从现在开始就叫你Iris，嘻嘻...
Hmph... Whatever...=嗯...随你的意...
Heehee, you can call me Ricca, too...=嘿嘿，你也可以叫我Ricca...
Huh...? Miss Fairy...? Iris...?=呵...？妖精小姐...？Iris...?
I can sense waves of evil from that direction. It must be a Drain Crystal.=我能感觉到来自那个方向的邪恶浪潮。肯定是个导能水晶.
I think that's where the valley is... That's the shortest path to the foot of the mountain.=我想那块是山谷...到山脚下最短的路。
So the goblins who kidnapped Miria are the same as the ones who attacked the settlement... Let's hurry!=绑架我姐姐和袭击定居点的是同一批哥布林...我们快点！
Chapter 3    Red Stone=第 3 章    红魔法石
The bridge is broken... That's too bad. Crossing this valley was the closest path to the foot of the mountain.=桥断了...太糟糕了。穿过这个山谷是最近的路呢。
It's a little too high to get over... It'll take us a bit more time, but let's find a path where the terrain is lower.=有点太高了，过不去...这要多花点时间，但我们还是找一条地势较低的路吧。
Hold on. You have the power to climb this cliff now.=等等。你现在有能力爬上这座悬崖。
What do you mean?=你什么意思？
You got a lot of Magic Stones from defeating the golem and destroying the Drain Crystal, right? You can use them here.=你击败石像鬼、摧毁导能水晶，获得了很多魔法石吧？ 你可以在这里使用它们。
Magic Stones...? What am I supposed to do with those things...? If I don't hurry, the goblins might hurt Miria...=魔法石...？我该怎么用...？如果我不快点，哥布林们可能会伤害姐姐...
Just listen to what I have to say. It'll help us get to her faster.=听我说。这能让我们更快地找到她。
Alright... I'll listen.=好吧...我会听的。
First, put your hand on the ornament on your chest... The red stone shaped like the sun on your brooch.=首先，把手放在胸前的装饰物品上...你胸针上太阳形状的红石。
Like this?=这样么？
Exactly. Now don't move.=没毛病。现在别动。
Hah!=哈！
Make sure to obtain or power up skills before proceeding.\r\nYou can gain skills via Skill Strengthening at Stage Select.=选择关卡时，\n记得强化已经获得的技能。

Urk... Ah...=唔...啊...
I can't believe you were defeated by such a weak monster. I suspected you were too incompetent to be a holy knight, but this is pitiful.=我不敢相信，你被这么弱小的怪物打败了。我怀疑你太无能了，不配成为一个圣骑士，这太可悲了。
My recovery spell didn't wake her up... Is she too fatigued?=我的恢复咒没能唤醒她...她是不是太累了？
Good grief... I'm going to take a look around to see if there are any monsters nearby, so don't move from that spot.=好悲伤...我要四处看看，看看附近有没有怪物，所以不要离开那个地方。
Highwayman A=强盗A
Bwahaha! I knew retracing the tracks that horde of monsters left would lead to something good. We struck lucky with that village!=哇哈！我就知道，追踪成群结队的怪物有好收获。我们在那个村子里走运了！
Highwayman B=强盗B
Bwahaha! Come on, man! Selling off the stolen goods will be enough to feed us for a while. Shouldn't we keep her around as our new toy instead?=哇哈！来吧，伙计！卖掉赃物，足以养活我们一段时间了。我们不应该把她当作我们的新玩具吗？
Or maybe...hehehe... She's got a babyface, but a brothel would pay us big to get her beautiful body, don'cha think?=或者也许...嘿嘿...她有童颜，但妓院会给我们很多钱来得到她美丽的身体，你不觉得吗？
The capital? Oh, I get it. She must be the daughter of some rich noble. She came here to become a hero, but got destroyed by the monsters instead! Gahaha!=王都？哦，我明白了。她一定是某个有钱贵族的女儿。她来这里是为了成为英雄，但却被怪物摧毁了！哈哈哈！
You're right. Heheh... She's plump in all the right spots. That's pretty sexy.=你说得对。嘿嘿...她身体各部位都丰满。太性感了。
It's a woman... Hold on, this girl's pretty young. She's got quite the get-up and weapon, too. Maybe she was fighting the monsters from earlier.=是个女人...等等，这个女孩很年轻。她也有装备和武器。也许她早些时候在和怪物战斗。

Is that right? Gahahaha! Alright, then let's take her to our hideout!=是这样吗？哈哈哈！好吧，那带她去我们的藏身处吧！
Yeah, we got to steal to our heart's content! There were no townspeople, and the monsters didn't wreck the place too bad. Shame we didn't find anything that would make us rich, though. Hehehe...=是啊，我们得尽情地偷东西！镇上没有人，怪物也没有把这个地方破坏得太严重。唯一的遗憾就是没找到能让我们致富的东西。嘿嘿...
That's true. With her looks, we might be able to sell her off even after we use her. Heheh... Not that any of the women we had in the past were that lucky.=没错。有了她的长相，我们甚至可以在用完她之后再卖掉。嘿嘿...我们过去的女人并不是都那么幸运。
She must've bought her weapon and armor, then. If her parents are loaded like you say she is, we can get a hefty ransom with her.=她一定是买了武器和盔甲。如果她的父母像你说的那么有钱，我们可以得到一大笔赎金。
Fighting the monsters? Hahaha! Look at her! That's not the face and figure of a knight. She's just...a fine lady.=与怪物战斗？哈哈哈！看看她！那不是骑士的脸和身材。她只是...一位漂亮的女子。
Mmm... Zzz... Huff...=嗯...Zzz...呼呼...
Gotcha. I'll use my usual sleeping drug on her just in case. Heheheh... Don't struggle too much, missy. Sweet dreams!=明白了。以防万一，我用常使的安眠药对付她。嘿嘿...不要挣扎太厉害哦，小姐。甜美的梦！

Whoops! That was close. Don't flap your legs like that. You don't look like it, but you're strong enough to carry around that big weapon, right?=哎呀！千钧一发啊。别那样摆动你的腿。虽然你看起来不像，但你强壮得足以随身携带那件大武器，对吗？

No, this can't... Aaah... It was my first time... He spent his seed inside me... No... Noooo! Stop, I don't want this! Take your fingers out...! Ooh, aaah, if you twist them around, the semen will leak in! Nnn! Aaah!=不，不能...啊...这是我的第一次...他在我体内撒下了种子...不...不不不不！住手，我不要这个！把你的手指拿出来...！哦，啊，如果你扭来扭去的，精液就会漏进去！嗯！啊！

Nn, haa, no... I hate this... I'm not a slut... I'm getting forcibly fucked, so why am I... Aaah, nnnh, stop... Aaah, no... I don't... I don't feel... Aah!=嗯，哈，不...我讨厌这个...我不是荡妇...我被强迫性交了，为什么我...啊，不，停下...啊，不...我不...我才不觉得...啊！
Woah, now that's what I like to see! I don't think I'll get bored of you any time soon. How about I let you go when you get pregnant and I can't sell you off anymore? You better keep your pussy tight until then!=哇，我想我不会很快厌倦你的。如果你怀孕了，不能再卖了，我就放你走怎么样？你最好在那之前紧绷你的阴部！
Aaah, nnn! Pregnant...? N-No! I don't want a baby...!=啊，嗯！怀孕...？不！我不想要孩子...！

Ten months after Ricca was abducted from the West Mountains and locked in the bandits' hideout...=Ricca被从西山绑架并锁在土匪的藏身处十个月后...
Ugh, this is so boring. I came loads in her and still no reaction.=额，太无聊了。我在她里面喷射了很多，但还是没有反应。
She's been like this for about a month. We don't have any more money, either. Maybe we should blow this hideout.=她这样已经有一个月了。咱也没有更多的钱了。也许我们应该炸掉这个藏身处。
Yeah, sounds good. The quarries and mines are infested with monsters now, and the port town is wrecked, too. There's nowhere left around here to make any money.=听起来不错。采石场和矿山现在到处都是怪物，港口城镇也被摧毁了。这附近没有地方可以赚钱了。
Aaah, look... My tummy... It's round like a baby tomato... A baby... Aha...=啊，看...我的肚子...它像番茄一样圆...婴儿...啊哈...
Fuck it, fine... Let's go look for a new cash grab opportunity. Heheh, I wish another fairy would come flying by. We could make a quick buck selling it off.=去他妈的，好吧...我们去寻找新的抢钱机会。嘿嘿，我希望另一个妖精能飞过。我们可以光速把她卖掉。

Collapsed Bridge Gorge=塌桥峡谷
Now use Sword Throw to get over that cliff.=如果我用魔法剑就可以越过那个悬崖。
Great, let's move forward.=嗯，我们快点出发吧。
Can I throw my sword here like earlier to get over this cliff?=用刚才学会的魔法剑能越过这个悬崖吗？
Yes, when you throw your magic sword, it can lodge into a vertical cliff and act as a foothold.=是的，你扔掉你的魔剑，可以创造立足点，哪怕是在角度接近垂直的悬崖上都能站稳。

Be careful with how much you use it, though. You can also throw it to attack faraway enemies, but it's not very powerful, and it consumes magic every time you use it.=飞剑也可以攻击到远处的敌人。但威力较小，每次使用都会消耗魔力，请注意。
Oh...? This feeling...=哦...？这个感觉...
Talk=讲话
There's a human under the ruins of that bridge.=那座桥的废墟下有一个人。
He's dressed just like Donny... Um, excuse me, mister soldier. Are you alright...?=他穿着就像Donny一样...嗯，内个，士兵先生。你还好吗...？
Eek...! They've found me!=草 ...！他们找到了我！

Um... I'm from the village west of here... I'm on my way to the settlement at the foot of the mountain...=嗯...我来自西山村...正在前往山脚下的定居点...
The village west of here...? Then you know that young guy, Donny, right? He was sent from the royal capital... Is he... Is your village safe...?=西山村...？那么你知道年轻的家伙，Donny，对吗？他被从皇都送来...他...你的村庄还很安全...对吗？
Donny was injured a little, but he's safe. But the village was ravaged by monsters...=Donny受了一点伤，但他没事。但村庄被怪物蹂躏...
I see... So those monsters attacked your village...=我明白了...所以那些怪物袭击了你的村庄...
Mister, you know about the monsters...?=先生，你了解怪物...？
I do... I was on my way to your village with a message for Donny, but a horde of monsters came from the direction I was heading...=嗯...我正在前往村庄，因为Donny报了信，但是一个部落的怪物在前路涌现...
I knew I didn't stand a chance fighting against them alone, so I was hiding here until it was safe... Before I knew it, it was the dead of night.=我知道我没有机会独自对抗他们，所以我躲在这里，直到变得安全点...唉，恐怖的死亡一夜。
I see... Um... D-Did you see anyone captured by the monsters?=是啊...嗯... 你，你看到任何被怪物捕获的人了吗？
No, I didn't... I was too focused on hiding from the monsters, I didn't notice any women...=不，我没有...我太专注于躲避怪物，我没有注意到任何女人...
A-Actually... I think I heard a woman's scream faintly among the voices of the goblins.=实，实际上...我听到了一个女人在哥布林的声音中微弱地尖叫。
Scream!? Mister, do you know where she... Do you know which direction those monsters went!?=尖叫！？先生，你知道她在哪里...你知道这些怪物的方位吗！？
They were going down the mountain in that direction... Are you looking for that woman...?=他们自那个方向走下了山...你在找那个女人吗？
I am... That woman was probably my sister...=我是...那个女人可能是我的姐姐...
Is that so... But a girl like you shouldn't be out here alone...=那么...但是像你这样的女孩不应该独自出来...

You don't say? I can't tell from your appearance, but you must be very strong...=别胡说？从你的外表上可看不出来，但你肯定非常强大...
I'm sorry. I'm certain I heard a scream... If only I was strong like you, I could have saved her...=对不起。我确定我听到了一个尖叫...只要我像你一样强壮，我就可以救她...
No, it's not your fault...=不，这不是你的错...
I'm so sorry... *Sniff* Damn it... Why couldn't I... I couldn't move my feet, and... Urk...=我很抱歉... *抽泣*草了...为什么我不能...不能迈向前去...
What a pathetic man. You're wasting your time talking to this human. Let's move on.=多么可怜的人。你正在浪费你的时间与这个人交谈。让我们继续前进。
Huh? I heard a voice coming from my body... Oh, it's Iris... Okay, we can go, but...=啊？我听到了我身体的声音...哦，是Iris...好吧，我们可以去，但是...

Thank you so much... Please be careful!=非常感谢...请小心！
The plants here are withered, too? But slimes were the only monsters I saw in this area before...=这里的草木都枯萎了？明明以前的魔物只有史莱姆...
I sense a Drain Crystal ahead of us. Let's find it and destroy it.=前面感觉到导能水晶的邪恶波动。找到后摧毁它吧。

Be careful when you're close to walls or when you're in narrow places like between pillars. Sometimes your sword will get stuck.=当你靠近墙壁或柱子之间的狭窄地方时要小心。请注意剑会被卡住。
I think this weapon is too big for me. It's kinda hard to wield... I wish God had given me a smaller, cuter weapon...=这把剑对我来说很难驾驭...如果神把它变成更小更可爱的武器就好了...
That might be enough for defeating slimes and goblins, but you'll need a sword this large to fight against big, strong monsters like golems.=史莱姆或者哥布林那种程度还好说，如果是石像鬼那样强大、坚韧的魔物，这样大的剑是非常有必要的。

You want to make a wound you can use to transfer holy power into them with your blade. If you attack the inside of the body directly like that, you can destroy any monster.=从剑身灌注的神圣之力可以用斩击造成大量伤害。能直接攻击魔物的内部，消灭各种魔物。
Huh... That's pretty...brutal...=呵呵...那挺...野蛮的哈...
Um... Iris... Why do you think the goblins kidnapped my sister?=嗯...Iris...为什么哥布林会抓走姐姐呢？
Well, what does your sister look like?=...你姐姐长得怎么样？
What does she look like...? She... Miria has...=姐姐的样子…？姐姐... Miria姐姐她...
Your weapon has been infused with Ice magic=你的武器已经融入了冰魔法
We both have the same hair and eye color, but she braids her hair in the back... And she ties it with the same kind of ribbon as me - the blue one Polon picked up earlier.=眼睛的颜色与我一样，头发也一样，只是在后面有三条辫子...就用这个Polon捡到的缎带绑在了一起。
Do you two have similar faces and figures?=...脸和身材也和你相似吗？
I guess you could say so... But Miria is taller and bustier. The men around her are always staring at her breasts...=样子的话大家都说很像...但是Miria姐姐的个子很高，身材也很好。男人们也总是盯着姐姐的胸部看...
Does she wear any accessories?=身上有什么首饰之类的东西？
Accessories...? No, she doesn't usually... Oh, actually, she was wearing the pink gem necklace I gave her the other day...=首饰？姐姐不太喜欢那样的东西...说起来，可能是戴了上次送的粉红宝石项链…
Pink, huh...? If it was a reddish color, it's possible... But why...?=粉红色的宝石...？如果是类似红色的话就有可能...但为什么...？
...I'm sorry. I don't know why your sister was taken.=...对不起，我也不知道你的姐姐为什么被抓走。
Oh... Okay...=嗯啊...是吗...
If you break Drain Crystals like this, it should reduce the number of monsters, too.=如果你像这样打破〖导能水晶〗，应该能减少怪物的数量。
Okay... Phew... I have to hurry and find Miria...=好的...呼呼...我必须赶紧找到Miria ...
Nnn... Haa... Haaa... Ngh... Haa... Haah...=嗯...哈哈...哈...唔嗯... 哈...哈哈...
You seem quite worn out. We should stop here and take a break.=你好像消耗了很多体力，差不多该停下来休息了。
B-But... My sister... I have to hurry...!=但...我的姐姐...我必须赶紧...！
Just listen to me. Stop moving and rest.=听我说，停下来休息。
I-I don't wanna... We don't know what the goblins could be doing to her...!=但、但是因为哥布林它们会对姐姐...！
...I said, "stop"!=...我说“停下”！
Whoa, you appeared out of nowhere... Eeeek!=啊，你从哪里冒出来的...
Huh...? Haa, haa... My form... I returned...to normal...=咦...？ 哈，哈...为什么…身体…又恢复原状了…
I lifted the transformation.=我解除了变身。
Ngh... Haa... Why...?=嗯...哈哈...为什么...？
You know you've been running around and fighting in your holy knight form since we lift the village, right?=你离开村子后一直以圣骑士的姿态战斗赶路吧？
Haa... Haa... I know... So what...?=哈哈...哈哈...我知道...所以...？
This magic item I gave you... The holy knight's brooch uses the wearer's magic to draw out holy power from the earth and sky.=这个魔导具...圣骑士的胸针使用佩戴者的魔力，从大地与空气中提取神圣的力量。
In other words, this brooch is the source of the holy power used to defeat demons. It's a very precious item, so handle it with care, okay?=换句话说，这个胸针是打倒魔物的神圣力量的来源。这是一个非常珍贵的东西，所以不能随意对待。
O-Okay... Huff... Haa... So... What then...?=嗯嗯...呼...哈...那个...然后...？
The brooch uses the magic within you to fuel holy knight powers. To put it another way, every time you wield the holy knight's power, it chips away at your own magic.=胸针将你自身的魔力作为燃料，将魔力转化为圣骑士的力量。反过来说，作为圣骑士每次施展力量，你都会消耗魔力。
When you run out of magic energy, you lose your holy knight abilities. I don't expect that you will exhaust your magic, as long as you don't use it recklessly or over a long period of time.=魔力耗尽的话就无法使用能力了。不过，不长时间使用的话，就不会消耗怎么多魔力吧。
Okay... I see... Thanks...for telling me that...=好的...我明白了...谢谢你...告诉我...
You seem to have as much magic as any regular human... It's clear to me that you're running low on both magic and stamina from your unsteady feet.=你现在的魔力就和普通人差不多...现在看来只是魔力和体力都用尽了，才变得摇摇晃晃的样子。
That's why you should rest in your normal form and restore your magic.=还是这样休息一下吧，等魔力恢复为好。
But... I have to get to my sister...=但是...我必须快些找回我的姐姐...
Do you really want to barge into a horde of monsters in that form? We don't even know what kinds of monsters are waiting for us ahead.=你打算就这样冲进魔物群？？不知道会有什么样的魔物会等着你呢。
But... The goblins took my sister... They could be doing awful things to her as we speak...!=但是...哥布林姐姐了我的妹妹...就在我们说话时，他们可以对她做出可怕的事情...！
I understand that you're worried, but if they're intending to rape her, she probably won't be killed. Besides...=我晓得你担心，但如果他们打算强奸她，她可能不会被杀。除此之外...
R-Rape...!? My sister...!? No, I can't let that happen...!=强、强奸...！？我的姐姐...！？不，我不能让这种情况发生...！
Let me finish! I think those goblins kidnapped your sister for a different purpose.=请听我把话说完！我认为那些哥布林把你姐姐抓走，另有目的。
Think about it. They even brought a golem to attack the village. If they just wanted to kidnap a random human, it would have been easier to ambush one on the road.=想一想。他们甚至带来了攻击村庄的石像鬼。想抓走人，还不如在必经之路上埋伏比较好。
Then why did they take away Miria...? My sister is... She's good at cooking and is a bit of a worrywart, but she's just a normal girl...=那他们为什么带走Miria ...？我姐姐是...只是个会做饭又爱操心的普通人啊...
Your sister's a real beauty, right? Maybe they're going to give her to Archlich as a gift...=你的姐姐很漂亮吧？难道是要作为礼物送给阿奎雷奇吗...
Whatever the reason, you need to rest now so you have the energy to catch up to them and find out.=嗯，为了追上它们找到原因，现在就需要休息。
Okay... I'll rest a little...=好的...我会休息一下...
Good. You really need the break.=嗯，那我们休息一下吧。
Well then... Heehee... If that's settled, we'd better prepare.=那么... 呵呵...决定了的话，就准备下吧。
First, go collect some branches we can use for firewood. By the time you're done with that, you should have recovered some magic. Then transform again, beat a slime and hell beetle, and bring them over here.=先收集树枝作为篝火，之后魔力会稍微恢复。你就再一次变身，打倒史莱姆和地狱甲虫，把它们搬过来。
Oh, but don't use your sword. The holy powers will immediately turn the corpse into Magic Stones, so punch them and knock them out instead. Hehe... Once you're done with all that, you can go to sleep.=但不要用你的剑。神圣的力量立即会将尸体转变为魔法石，所以打晕它们就好了。呵呵...等结束了，再睡一会吧。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Ugh, Iris... For someone who told me to rest, she sure works me hard... She's not gentle, and she's sort of scary. She's not like how I imagined fairies to be...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呃，Iris...都说让我休息了，还让我乱来...她不温柔，总感觉她有点可怕。和我想像中的妖精有些不一样啊...）

Wh-What was that, Miria...? I couldn't hear you well... What kind of meat? Is it lamb again...?=那，那是什么，姐姐...？我听不清楚你的声音...哪种肉？是羔羊吗？
No... Today's meat is... Khehehehe...=不...今天的肉是...啧啧啧...

I-I was...chosen to be a holy knight by God... I can...defeat these goblins...=我，我...被选为上帝的圣骑士...我可以...击败这些哥布林...

Chapter 4    The Brooch of Sunlight=第 4 章    阳光胸针
I see... So you lost both your parents... I'm sorry for bringing back sad memories.=我晓得...你失去了父母...忆及伤心处了，抱歉。
It's okay. I was little and I don't remember much about them, anyway. Besides, I've always had Miria around, so I wasn't lonely at all, and I had friends like Olivia and Polon to play with...=没关系。无论如何，我很小，我不记得他们。此外，我一直都在姐姐身边，我根本不孤独，我有朋友Olivia，能和Polon玩...
Heehee... What about your family, Iris? Do you have any siblings? Or are fairies born from flowers?=嘿嘿...你的家人怎么样？你有兄弟姐妹吗？或者是从鲜花出生的妖精？
What, flowers? Heehee, of course not. We're born from our mothers, just like humans.=什么，鲜花？嘿嘿，当然没有。我们从母亲分娩而生，像人类一样。
My parents and grandparents should be doing well in the neighboring village, but I've been so busy with serving God, I haven't had the chance to visit them lately.=我的父母和祖父母应该在邻近的村庄，干的一把好手，但我最近一直忙于服侍上帝，没有机会去拜访他们。
Oh... And I have a younger brother...=哦...我有一个弟弟...
Younger brother?=弟弟？
Yes, he's around the same age as you...=是的，他约与你同龄...
Hmm... A boy fairy, huh? Do all fairies look like you, Iris?=嗯...一个男小精灵，是不？所有精灵都像你似的吗， Iris？
I suppose so...=我想是这样...
Heehee, if he's your brother, he must be handsome! Or maybe he's the cute type since he's small and has wings. That's so nice...=嘿嘿，如果他是你的兄弟，他一定英俊！或者他是很小很可爱的类型，并且有翅膀。那太好了...
...It isn't. Anyway, that human soldier said something about a settlement in the forest. Do you think it's far from here?=...他不是。不说这个，人类士兵说了些关于森林的定居点。你觉得它距离这里远吗？
Huh...? Yeah, I think it'll take us about half a day to get there. Oh, but if I head there in my holy knight form, we might get there sooner. I can run much faster when I transform.=嗯...？是啊，我们大约半天能到达那里。但如果我开圣骑士模式，我可以跑得更快。
Hehe, then you could run even faster without armor. It seems like this area doesn't have strong monsters. It should be no problem if you're lightly dressed.=呵呵，那么你在没有铠甲的时候，跑得不是更快吗。似乎这个地区没有强壮的怪物。你轻装上阵，应该也没问题。
What? So you want me to take off the armor after I transform into a knight? But that armor's white and shiny. It must be expensive...=什么？所以你想让我在变圣骑士后脱掉盔甲？但那个盔甲那么白，那么闪亮。一定很值钱...
Teehee... No, you just have to transform into a holy knight without forming the armor.=嘿嘿 ...不，你只需要变身为一个没有形成盔甲的圣骑士。
When you transform with the brooch, imagine yourself only wearing the blue dress. You should be able to transform based on that mental image.=您应该能够基于心理图像进行变身。你用胸针变身，想象自己只穿着蓝色的裙裾。
Wow, I didn't know I could that! This brooch is amazing.=哇，我不知道，我可以！这个胸针好牛哇。
Huh...? If I can transform into whatever I imagine, does that mean I can change into other forms?=呵呵...？如果我可以变身为我想象的，这是否意味着我可以改为其他装饰？
Now you're getting it, heehee... If you can imagine it, you can change not just your clothes, but your face and body, even the color of your skin.=现在你已经得到了它，嘿嘿...如果你能想象，你就可以改变你的衣服，甚至是你的脸和身体、肤色。
Even my face and body...? Wow... Oh, is that the reason why my breasts get a little bigger when I transform...?=我的脸和身体...？哇...哦，怪不得变身时我的乳房变大了...？
Teehee... That must be your ideal form.=嗨哈...这一定是你理想的模样。
When you transform into a different outfit for the first time, you'll have to consume a lot of magic to make the outfit from scratch. Just like strengthening your abilities, you'll need to collect a lot of Magic Stones to do this.=当你第一次变身为不同的装饰时，必须消耗很多魔法来从头开始制作衣服。就像加强你的能力一样，你需要收集很多魔石来这么做。
The holy knight's armor and gauntlets provide great defense thanks to their divine protection, but they're a little heavy.=由于他们的神圣保护，圣骑士的盔甲和防护手套提供了很大的防御值，但它们是大型辎重。
When you're traveling a long distance or dealing with a fast monster, you might want to change into your lightweight form.=当您长途旅行或应对敏捷的怪物时，您可能希望改为轻量级装扮。

That plant became a demon plant through the influence of the Drain Crystal. It'll hurt you if you touch it carelessly.=那株植物在导能水晶的影响下变成了恶魔植物。不小心点的话，会伤害你的。
Some monster plants spit out seeds that infest humans. If that happens to you, you need to cut the vines off immediately, or else your whole body will get trapped in vines.=一些怪异植物吐出的种子会感染人类。如果发生在你身上，需要立即砍掉藤蔓，否则你的整个身体都会被困在藤里。

Huff... Huff... I can't believe you ran away without me, Iris... Haa... Haa...=呼...呼...嘿呀，Iris，你不带我就跑了是吧... 哈...哈...
Heehee... Come on, you were able to escape it. And thanks to your hard work, we were able to beat the golem without even fighting it.=嘿嘿...拜托，你能逃脱的。多亏了你的努力，我们甚至不用与石像鬼搏斗就能打败它。
Is that...huff, huff...supposed to make me...feel better...?=那...呼...哈...让我...心气顺点了吗...？
Haa... There goes...all my energy... Now I need to rest again...after running...huff, huff...with all my might...=哈...就这...耗费了...我所有的精力...现在我需要再次休息..哈，哈...尽我所能...
I'm sorry... I just...need a minute...=哎呀...我只是...一小会...
Alright. In the meantime, I'll go look at the remains of the golem. I might find clues about the monsters who attacked the village.=好吧。同时，我要去看看石像鬼的遗骸。也许能找到袭击村子的怪物的线索。
Ugh... I'm so sweaty... Even my clothes and hair are wet... Oh, right... I'm supposed to return to my normal form when I rest...=呃...我浑身都是汗...我的衣服和头发都湿了...哦，对了...我应该在休息时恢复正常状态...
Phew... We should get going now. Okay, so I place the brooch on my chest...and imagine myself as a knight...=呼...我们该走了。好吧，我把胸针放在胸前...把自己想象成骑士...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Miria...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>姐姐...)
(<indent%3D0.4em>The sword and armor are a bit much, but the hair ornaments and white gloves that come with the holy knight form are kinda cute. They remind me of Olivia at her wedding... She was beautiful, and she looked so happy with her groom...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>剑和盔甲有点多了，但随附的 圣骑士的发饰和白手套有点可爱。不禁让我想起Olivia在她的婚礼上的模样...她很漂亮，和新郎在一起，看起来很开心......）
(<indent%3D0.4em>She's probably safe from the monsters in the capital...but she's going to be so sad when she finds out that all those people in the village died...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>她在王都可能不会受到怪物的伤害...但如果她发现村里所有的人都死了，她会非常伤心......）
Huh...? Oh, I see. So my sweat is cleaned when I transform...=呵...？哦，我明白了。我变身的话，我的汗水会被清理干净...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Did all the filth from the goblins disappear...when I transformed for the first time in the church...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>身上所有的哥布林污秽都消失了吗...就像我在教堂里第一次变身时...？）
(<indent%3D0.4em>I...hope so...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我...希望如此......）
Iris, I'm done resting!=Iris, 我休息完了！
This rock... There are bits of metal in it... I think it's copper...=这块石头...里面有一些金属碎片...我想是铜的...
It must have been made out of mined rock... Does that mean the monsters' base is there?=它一定是由开采的岩矿制成的...这是否意味着怪物的基地就在那里？
Iris, was that golem made by that bad wizard Archlich?=Iris, 那个石像鬼是那个坏巫师阿奎雷奇做的吗？
Huh...? Y-Yes. A golem this big, strong and persistent couldn't have been made by a goblin.=呵...？是，是啊。这么大、这么强壮、这么执着的石像鬼是哥布林做不出来的。
Okaaay... Well, I'm done resting.=好吧...我休息完了。
Oh, are you? Then let's head out.=哦，是吗？那我们出发吧。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Miria... I hope you're safe...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>姐姐... 希望你平安无事......）
Chapter 5    The Revived Stone Giant=第 5 章    复活的石像鬼
We're so close to reaching the forest at the foot of the mountain, too... Ouch... Ack... It didn't hurt this much earlier...=我们也快到山脚下的森林了...哎哟...啧...之前可没这么疼...
Your body is strengthened with holy power during battle and suppresses pain so you can focus on fighting. Is this the spot the beetle horn hit you?=你的身体在战斗中会被神圣力量强化，并抑制疼痛，因此你可以专注于战斗。这是甲虫之角击中你的地方吗？
Eek! Th-That's it. Ouch... Hnnngh... Owww... Huff... Huff... Be gentle with it...=哎呀！就，就是那块。哎哟...嗯...哦...呼...呼...温柔一点...
Oh, sorry.=哦，对不起。
Ugh... Will you stop slapping it?=呃...你能不能别拍了？
*Sigh* How does it look? It's not bleeding and it doesn't hurt as long as I don't move it, so it's not too bad, right?=*唉* 看起来怎么样？只要我不动它就不会流血也不会痛，所以也不算太糟，对吧？
Well, from the looks of it... Your bone isn't badly broken, but it might have a fracture. You should rest until it heals.=从表面上看...你的骨头没有严重损伤，但可能骨折了。你应该休息直到痊愈。
Don't worry, you just have to wait for the holy knight healing powers to kick in.=别担心，你只需要等待神圣骑士的治疗能力发挥作用。
A fracture in my bone...!? It's that bad!? No wonder it hurt... How long do I have to wait?=我骨折了...！？这么糟糕！？难怪疼呢...我要等多久？
If you focus your magic on your injury, it should take about half a day. If we want to be safe, though, we should rest for a whole day.=如果你把你的魔法集中在你的伤上，需要大约半天的时间。如果我们想安全些，该休息一整天。
That long? I just recovered from running a moment ago, too... I need to go save Miria...=那么长？我也刚从跑步中恢复过来...我得去救姐姐...
If you were a normal human, this would take you months to recover from. I know you're in a hurry, but we can't go forward if you can't fight monsters. Don't leave your guard down next time.=如果你是一个正常人，需要几个月的时间来恢复。我知道你赶时间，但如果你不能和怪物战斗，我们就不能前进。下次不要放松警惕。
Ngh... Okay... I understand...=嗯...可以...我理解...
...I'm sorry...Miria...=...我很抱歉...姐姐...
Fine, fine. Just give me a sec.=得，得。等我一下。
We have Magic Stones... I prefer to use these for creating equipment and strengthening abilities, but...=我们有魔法石...我更喜欢用这些来创造装备和增强能力，但是...
Here's a Life Crystal. Just sprinkle the recovery magic inside this thing over your injury and it'll heal in the blink of an eye.=这是一个生命水晶。只要在你的伤口上撒上恢复魔法，它就会在眨眼间愈合。
Wow... Did you make that crystal out of Magic Stones?=哇！那水晶是你用魔法石做的吗？
Yes. You can use Magic Stones to strengthen your holy knight abilities and make other useful crystals for battle.=对。你可以使用魔法石来加强你的神圣骑士能力，并为战斗制造其他有用的水晶。
I thought you humans knew about this too.=我以为你们人类知道呢。
Now that you mention it, I think I saw something about that in a book at the general store. The mayor told me about it a long time ago, too.=既然你提到了，我想我在杂货店的一本书中看到了这方面的内容。村长很久以前也告诉过我这件事。
Hehe... So that's why the travelers that visit my village buy Magic Stones. They were using them to make crystals like this.=呵呵...来我们村的游客会买魔法石，原来是要用来制作这样的晶体。
Most likely. Converting Magic Stones into other crystals takes a couple of steps, but anyone can do it once they get the hang of it. I'll teach you too.=很有可能。将魔法石转化为其他水晶需要几个步骤，但任何人只要掌握了窍门就可以做到。我也会教你的。
Oh, really? I'd love to know.=哦，真的吗？我很想了解一下。
Heheh, I'm fine with teaching you, but making useful crystals takes a lot of Magic Stones. That'll mean fewer stones for strengthening abilities and creating equipment, so you better keep your priorities in mind.=呵呵，我很乐意教你，但是制作有用的水晶需要很多魔法石。同时将意味着用于增强能力和创造装备的魔法石更少，所以你最好记住你的优先事项。

Nnnnh... Haaa... Urk...=嗯...哈...呜...
When the goblins appeared, I staggered up the bell tower in horror and rang the bell over and over.=当哥布林出现时，我惊恐地摇摇晃晃地爬上钟楼，一次又一次地按铃。
Yet no one came to save me. I tried to fight back by throwing whatever I could grab at them, but I was still captured.=然而没有人来救我。我试图向他们投掷能摸到的所有家伙事儿来反击，但我还是被抓住了。
After I was taken out of the church, they tied my hands and feet. I was loaded onto a cart and I road the bumpy mountain path for hours.=我被带出教堂后，他们捆住了我的手脚。我被装上一辆手推车，在崎岖的山路上走了几个小时。
I twisted my body in an attempt to escape whenever the goblins turned their backs on me. My struggle left my hair a mess and my body exhausted.=每当哥布林们背对着我时，我就扭着身子试图逃跑。我挣扎得发丝凌乱不堪，身体疲惫。
Aye! I'm back, fellas!=是！我回来了，伙计们！
Khehehe! Captain! How did your mission go!?=呵呵！队长！你的任务进展如何！？
I found the human that Master Archlich told us about. I ordered the golem to capture it, but I'm not sure if that will work.=我找到了阿奎雷奇告诉的那个人。我命令石像鬼捕捉她，但我不确定是否有效。
I see... Then did you capture this woman by mistake? What should we do with her?=我懂了...那你是不是误抓了这个女人？我们该拿她怎么办？
The green demi-humans snicker as they look at me...=绿色半人看着我窃笑...
All the other people from the village who were caught by the goblins were killed, but I was kept alive. They seemed to have mistaken me for someone.=村里其他所有被哥布林抓到的人都被杀了，但我还活着。他们好像把我错当成什么人了。
But now that they realize they have the wrong person, I'm probably going to be killed, too...=但现在他们意识找错人了，我可能也会被杀...
Khehehehe, I've never seen a woman with such a hot body... Can we have a go at her?=呵呵呵，我从没见过有这么性感的身体的女人...我们能试试她吗？
No, take her to the fortress. She's probably related to the human we're looking for, so she might come in handy...=不，带她去要塞。她可能和我们要找的人有亲戚关系，所以她可能会派上用场...
(<indent%3D0.4em>What...? Related...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>什么...？沾亲...？）
My parents died of the flux, and my other relatives live in a town far away. The only other family I had in my village was...=我的父母患病去世，其他亲戚住在很远的城镇。我在村里的唯一亲属是...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Oh, Ricca... She must be safe... Thank goodness... But why...? Why are they looking for her...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>哦，Ricca... 她一定很安全...谢天谢地...但为什么...？他们为什么要找她......？）
She's just a girl living in a mountain village. What could the goblins ever want her for?=她只是一个住在山村的女孩。哥布林想要她干什么？
Did they mistake her for another person? Or...=他们把她错当成另一个人了吗？或者...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Is this because...I prayed to God...at the church? Is this a test...? No... A punishment? Why...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>是因为...我在教堂...向上帝祈祷？这是测试吗...？不要... 是天罚？为什么......？）
Although my heart was still filled with uneasiness, I felt relieved to know my sister was safe, and that the goblins would not kill me.=虽然我的心仍然充满了不安，但当我知道我妹妹很安全，哥布林不会杀我时，我感到松了一口气。
However, weakened by fatigue and fear, I was close to losing consciousness.=然而，由于疲劳和恐惧，我几乎失去了知觉。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Urk... Ah... Uugh... Ricc...a...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呜... 啊...啊...Ricc...a ...）
As my gaze naturally lowered from drowsiness, I saw the necklace I obtained from the merchant via Ricca.=我的目光从睡意中自然地垂下，我看到了我通过Ricca从商人那里得到的项链。
In my fading consciousness, I recalled the day we were given that bewitching pendant with the colorful gem.=在我渐渐淡出的意识中，我回忆起有一天，我们得到了那件带有彩色宝石的迷人吊坠。
Haa... Aaahnn... Ah... Nooo...=哈...啊嗯...啊...不...
Bwahaha, it's been a while since you made a move on me, Miss Miria. You're not doing this just because I gave you that necklace, right?=卟哈哈，你已经有一段时间没有对我采取行动了，Miria小姐。 你这么做不是因为我给了你那条项链，对吧？
I was at the village's general store in the middle of the night, lingerie, my body penetrated by a middle-aged man with a nasty laugh.=半夜三更我在村里的百货商店，我服贴身内衣裤，身体被一个中年男人穿透，他发出下流的笑声。
Ah... Nnnh, yes... Because of the monsters, fewer travelers visit the village now... Aaah...=啊...嗯，是的...由于怪物的存在，现在来这个村子旅游的人越来越少了...啊...
When I was Ricca's age, I was sick of all the men looking at my breasts and butt.=我像Ricca这么大的时候，我讨厌所有男人盯着我的乳房和屁股看。
I started selling my alluring body to travelers and merchants visiting the village five or six years ago.=五六年前，我开始向来村子的游客和商人出售我迷人的身体。
Ricca was growing and needed more food, as well as items to care for her appearance as a young woman. Money started to become tight.=Ricca正在长身子，需要更多的食物，以及照顾年轻女性外貌的物品。资金开始变得紧张。
I work as a waitress and cook in the daytime at the dining hall, handing out letters to customers who might be interested in me, when serving with their meals. At night, I invite them over to the church.=我白天在餐厅做服务员和厨师，在用餐时给可能对我感兴趣的顾客发信件。晚上，我邀请他们去教堂。
This evening job is kept secret from Ricca, of course.=当然，这个晚上的工作是对Ricca保密的。
Nnn, haah... Because there are fewer travelers... I haven't been able to earn much money... Aaah... I can only rely...nnnh...on you...=嗯，哈...因为旅行者少了...我没能挣到多少钱...啊...我只能依靠在...嗯...你身上...
I avoid travelers who visit often so as not to make regular customers, and since no one comes to the church in the middle of the night, I doubt the villagers know about my evening work.=我避开经常来的游客，这样就不会形成常客，而且因为没有人半夜来教堂，我怀疑村民们是否知道我晚上的工作。
Either that or they avoid me out of fear, still believing in that rumor, over ten years after my parents' deaths... They think that my family brought the flux into this village.=要么就是他们因为害怕而躲着我，在我父母去世十多年后，他们仍然相信那个谣言...他们认为是我的家人把病带进了这个村子。
They all avoid us, except for this man fucking me...=他们都躲着我，除了那个和我上床的男人...
I see, my shop's struggling from the drop in business, too... Huff, huff... It's been a while since I last fucked you, but your pussy's still as good as ever!=我明白了，我的商店也在为生意下滑而挣扎...呼，呼...我已经有一段时间没跟你上床了，但你的阴部还是一如既往的好！
Aah, Aaaah... Thank you...very much... Aah...=啊，啊...非常...感谢...啊...
I stay respectful and thank the general store's owner. With so few travelers visiting the village these days, I have to be careful not to offend the few good customers I have.=我很尊重并感谢杂货店的老板。这些天来村子里旅游的人太少了，我必须小心，不要冒犯我仅有的几个好顾客。
Huff, huff... But I thought you quit doing this job? That's what you told me a month ago when I asked you for your service.=呼，呼...但我以为你不干了呢，一个月前，当我请求你提供服务时，你就是这么告诉我的。
Ricca's a big girl now. Huff, huff... And I give her extra pay, so I doubt you two are struggling to get by.=Ricca现在是个大女孩了。呼，呼...我给了她额外的薪水，所以我怀疑你们两个是不是很难过日子。
Nnn... I... Ah... Appreciate that... Ah, nnnh... But... Haa, aah... I want to...send her to the capital as soon as possible...=嗯...我...啊...感谢...你啊，嗯...但是...哈，啊...我想...尽快送她去王都...
This village is nothing compared to the town we used to live in before moving.=这个村子和我们搬家前住过的那个镇相比简直是小巫见大巫。
A girl at her age should go out into a bustling town to learn instead of being stuck in a boring village.=一个像她这样年纪的女孩应该到一个繁华的小镇去学习，而不是被困在一个无聊的村子里。
And just like Olivia from the blacksmith's family, she might get a chance to meet rich men in the city.=就像铁匠家里的Olivia，她可能有机会在城里遇到有钱人。
Aaah... Nnn... Ah, haaa... But she's being stubborn about going to the city...=啊...嗯...啊，哈...但她固执地不愿去城里。...
Nnn... So I thought I'd go with her... I'm worried about letting her live on her own, too...=嗯...所以我想我得和她一起去...我也担心让她独自生活...
I understand how shameless it is to use this body my parents gave me to have sex with men in exchange for money.=我明白用父母给我的身体和男人做爱来换取金钱是多么无耻。
But my greatest wish is to make Ricca happy.=但我最大的愿望是Ricca快乐。
She may be my sister, but she's like a daughter to me. For her, I would give my body to however many men it took.=她是我的妹妹，但她对我来说就像个女儿。为了她，我愿意把我的身体给无数的男人。
I see... I think you're worrying too much, but... Huff... If that's the case, let me get my money's worth out of you...=我懂了...我觉得你操心太多了，但是...呼...如果是这样的话，让我把钱花在你身上...
Aaaaaah... Yes... Haa... Haa... Nnngh... Please...have your fill...=啊啊啊...对...哈...哈...嗯...请...把你的填满...
I entice the merchant's lust with the same phrase I use when serving meals.=我用我在上菜时用过的一句话诱惑商人的欲望。
Since I have to work tomorrow too, I can't afford to prolong our illicit meeting.=因为我明天还得工作，我不能再延长我们的非法会面了。
Eeek... Aah... Ack... Nnh... Haah, eek... Don't get so rough...without warning... Nooo...=哎呀...啊...啊...嗯...哈，嗯...别这么粗暴...没警告过...不要...
Ghehehe, I'm so lucky I get to buy the time of a pretty girl like you...You say you're doing this for Ricca, but you actually can't get enough of my cock, right?=哈哈，我真幸运，我能买到你这样漂亮女孩的时间...你说你这么做是为了Ricca，但实际上你还是尝不够我的鸡巴，对吧?？
Shluck... Shluck...=冲...冲...
Aaann... Urk... That's not...aah, haaah...true at all...=啊嗯...呜... 根本...啊哈...不是...
Then why are you making such lewd moans? Huff, huff... You'll wake up my wife upstairs if you're too loud.=那你为什么发出这么下流的呻吟声？呼，呼...如果你太大声的话，会把我楼上的妻子吵醒的。
Aaan, nooo... That's because you're... Ah, aaah, aaah...! Thrusting so hard...! Nnnh...!=啊，不...那是因为你...啊，啊，啊...！用太力冲刺...！嗯...！
Counting today, I think this is my eighth time doing it with the merchant.=算上今天，我想这是我第八次和商人一起做这件事了。
I have a good idea of what turns this old man on, so I moan quietly enough to avoid waking up his wife sleeping upstairs, but loud enough to excite him.=我很清楚什么能让这位老人兴奋，所以我轻轻地呻吟，以免吵醒睡在楼上的妻子，但声音足够大，足以让他兴奋。
Ghahaha, you want to talk back, you slut? What do you think Ricca would say if she saw you getting fucked by me?=哈哈，你想顶嘴吗，荡妇？你觉得如果Ricca看到你被我操了会说什么？
Aah, haa, nooo! Ah... Haaa... Haaa... Don't bring...her up... Aaah...!=啊，哈，不！啊...哈...哈...不要...不要提起她...啊...！
My body suddenly gets hotter. I fail to hold back a loud moan when I feel the pleasure build up below me.=我的身体突然变热了。当我感到快乐在我下面形成时，我无法抑制一声大声的呻吟。
All my gasping and responses are supposed to be acting... But despite my efforts to stay internally composed, I can't fight back the shivers I feel when Ricca is brought up.=我所有的喘息和反应都应该是在演戏...但是，尽管我努力保持内心平静，但当我提到Ricca时，我还是禁不住打了个寒颤。
Shlop, shlop, shlop...!=嘘，嘘，嘘...！
Ah, aaah... nnngh... Sto... Aaah... Haa... Y-You're too rough...! Nooo...!=啊，啊...嗯...停...啊...哈...你太粗鲁了...！不...！
Ghehehe, you're so wet... If Ricca saw how slutty her big sister is, she might become a prostitute just like you!=嘿嘿，你太湿了...如果Ricca看到她老姐有多放荡，她可能会像你一样成为妓女！
D-Don't say such... Aah, aah, aaaah...!=别，别这么说...啊，啊，啊...！
The merchant must have realized I am losing my composure.=商人一定意识到我正在失去镇静。
He uses words like "big sister" to make me think of Ricca, and continues to fuck me even harder.=他用“老姐”这样的词让我想起Ricca，而且还继续更厉害地操我。
Ricca's been getting bustier lately, just like you! I'm sure she's going to end up becoming a slutty sexy woman, too. When that happens, I'll be more than happy to fuck both of you!=Ricca就像你一样，最近也越来越丰满了！我相信她最终也会成为一个放荡性感的女人。到那时候，我会很高兴地操你们两个滴！
Aaah... No... Nnnh, uurk... Stop...=啊...不要... 嗯，呜呜...停下
Please, Mister... Please don't think of her... Please don't think of my sister like that... Aaaah... Please, I'm begging you...=求你了，先生...请不要打她的主意...请不要那样想我妹妹...啊...求你了，我求你了...
Ghehehehe, I'm just joking...! But saying these things turns you on, right? See... You're getting tighter, you masochistic cow!=嘿嘿，我只是开玩笑...！但是说这些话会让你兴奋，对吗？看...你越来越紧了，你这个受虐狂！
Urk, ah, eek... Aaah... No, you're wrong... I'm not that kind of woman... Noo, ah, aaah...=呜，哎呀...啊...不，你想错了...我不是那种女人...不，啊，啊...
I rebutted his vulgar remarks, but what the merchant said was true.=我驳斥了他的粗俗言论，但商人说的是真的。
Among the men I sold my body to were crude adventurers and tradesmen who boorishly flaunted their money.=我把自己的身体卖给了一些粗鄙的冒险家和商人，他们粗野地炫耀自己的钱财。
These types look down at me as a poor country woman, and sex with them is always degrading and violent like rape.=这些人看不起我，认为我是一个贫穷的乡下女人，和他们做爱总是像强奸一样有辱人格和暴力。
Possibly because of these experiences, my body grew to feel pleasure from being verbally abused while getting forcefully penetrated.=可能因为这些经历，我的身体在被强行插入的同时，从口头上的辱骂中获得快感。
Aaah, noo... Nnngh, stop... Mister, your thing... Eek, haa, haaa... Aah, nooo... It's so hard... It feels so good...=啊，不...停下...先生，你的那个...哈，哈，哈...啊，不...太硬了...感觉真好...
Huff, huff... Don't call it a thing like you're some innocent girl. A slut like you should call it a cock! A fat cock! You even wore that necklace to seduce me, didn't you!?=呼，呼...不要说你是个无辜的女孩。像你这样的荡妇应该叫它鸡巴！一只肥鸡巴！你甚至戴着那条项链来勾引我，不是吗！？
Ah, aaaah... Uuff... Okay... Your cock...feels amazing...=啊，啊...哎呀...可以的...你的鸡巴...感觉棒极了...
Ahhnn... Haa, haa... I wore this pendant, nngh! To make you happy, too...!=嗯...哈，哈哈...我戴着这个吊坠，嗯！来让你也开心...！
Is that so? Ghahaha, you really are slut... Oof, you're getting tighter. I'm at my limit... I'm cumming... I'm gonna cum in you, you got that!?=是这样吗？哈哈，你真是荡妇...哦，你越来越紧了。我已经到了极限...我要射了... 我要给你射里面，明白吗！？
Ah, aah, eek... Yes, please cum in me... I should be safe today...=啊，啊，哎呀...好，请射进我里面...今天应该很安全...
Pour your semen... Aah, nnngh... Into my slutty pussy...with your cock...=倒出你的精液...啊，嗯...进入我的淫荡阴部...用你的鸡巴...
I've taught Ricca to conduct herself with modesty like any respectable girl. I would never utter these obscene words in front of her.=我教过Ricca，受人尊敬的女孩需要举止谦逊。我决不会在她面前说这些下流话。
But this is the only way I can satisfy this man and release his semen.=但这是我唯一能让这个男人满意并释放他的精液的方法。
I tell myself I have to do this...but I'm aware I'm making excuses. I've been giving in to this indecent body's greed for pleasure.=我告诉自己我必须这么做...但我知道我在找借口。我已经屈服于这个下流的身体对快乐的贪婪。
Aaah, aaah... So good... Hurry, I want your cock, mister...=啊，啊...好爽...快点，我要你的鸡巴，先生...
Ah, haa... Please pour your semen into my slutty pussy... Haa... Nngh... Aaah, aaaah...!=啊，哈...请把你的精液倒进我淫荡的阴部...哈...嗯...啊，啊...！
Every time I degrade myself with obscene words, the pleasure becomes stronger and climax comes closer.=每次我用淫秽的话贬低自己，快乐就会变得更强烈，高潮也就更近了。
Ooooh, you're so tight! I'm cumming...! You better cum as I fill you up, Miria, you slutty cow!=你太紧了！我要高潮了...! 你最好在我给你注入的时候一起高潮，Miria，你这淫荡的母牛！
Yes... I'm gonna cum - I'm cumming... Aah, aah, hyaaah... My cow pussy... Make my pussy cum with your cock, Mister. Please let me cum...!=对...我要高潮了... 我高潮了...啊，啊，啊...我的母牛小穴...先生，用你的鸡巴让我的阴部高潮。请让我高潮...！
My masochistic instinct heightens as it seeks humiliation and pleasure. I lay bare my raw desire with earnest moans and vulgar pleas.=我的受虐本能在寻求屈辱和快乐时会增强。我用诚挚的呻吟和粗俗的恳求来表达我的原始欲望。
Ghufff! Ooooooh!=呼呼！噢！
*Splurt! Droop! Spluuuuurt!*=*拟音*
Aaah, I'm cumming! Hhhaaaaaaaaannngh! Hhhnngh! Nnnh... Haaaa.... Aaaaaaaaaaaah!=啊，我要高潮了! 哈哈啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！哼！嗯嗯...哈哈...啊啊啊！
I visibly lapse into pleasure. I could never show this expression to my sister.=我显然陷入了快乐之中。我永远无法向我妹妹展示这种表情。
Even though my voice was loud enough to reach the second floor, I couldn't hold back my moans from the overwhelming pleasure. It had been a long time since my hunger for sadism was satisfied.=尽管我的声音大到可以传到二楼，我还是无法抑制住我的呻吟，因为我欣喜若狂。我对施虐的渴望已经很久没有得到满足了。。
Nnnh, haah, haaaaaaaaaah...=嗯，哈，哈哈啊啊...
Huff, Huff... Ghehehehe... I enjoyed that...=呼，呼...嘿嘿嘿嘿...我很享受...
My spine shivered as he pulled out his softened penis from my milky vagina.=当他从我乳白色的阴道中拔出他柔软的阴茎时，我的脊柱都颤抖。
Huff...=呼...
I...gave in to pleasure again...=我...再次向快乐屈服...
But...that wasn't enough... I want something more intense...=但是这还不够...我想要更强烈的...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Oh... N-No... I don't want more of this... This is all an act...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>哦...不，不... 我不想再这样了...这都是演戏才是......）
(<indent%3D0.4em>I just have to keep acting until he pays me... I don't want to ruin his mood...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我必须继续表演直到他付钱给我...我不想破坏他的心情......）
There's still some time before dawn, so the merchant will probably ask for another round or two.=黎明前还有一段时间，所以商人可能会要求再进行一两轮。
If so, I can get even more money out of him... I need to save up for Ricca...and I need to calm my body. It's still turned on from cumming for the first time in a while, so I need more...=如果是这样的话，我可以从他那儿得到更多的钱...我需要为Ricca存点钱，以备不时之需...我需要让我的身体平静下来。这是高潮一段时间以来第一次打开它，所以我需要更多...
With these thoughts clouding my mind, I searched for the merchant to show him I wanted to continue having sex.=这些想法笼罩着我的头脑，我寻找那个商人，让他知道我想继续做爱。
U-Um... I...want more... Could we...do it one more time...?=嗯，呃...我想要更多...我们能否...再做一次...？
The first time I sold myself to this merchant was when he accidentally saw me entertaining a traveler. Worried that he would expose me, I visited him at his store.=我第一次把自己卖给这个商人是在他偶然看到我招待一个旅行者的时候。我担心他会揭发我，所以去了他的店里。
After shamelessly greeting him, I resolved myself and told him my situation. The man laughed about how much I must be earning and then asked to buy my services.=我厚颜无耻地跟他打了招呼，打定了主意，把我的情况告诉了他。这个人嘲笑我一定能挣多少钱，然后要求购买我的服务。
He may have meant it as a vulgar joke to ease the tension, but I seduced him to make him my accomplice.=他可能是想用粗俗的笑话来缓和紧张气氛，但我引诱他，让他成为我的同谋。
Oh, well... Hmm... I think I had enough for today.=哦，内个...嗯... 我想我今天已经够了。
What...? You had enough...? Oh... Okay...=什么...？你够了...？哦...好的...
I was stunned for a brief moment when the man answered me with his slightly puzzled expression.=当那个男人用略带困惑的表情回答我时，我震惊了片刻。
The man before my eyes is a horny, unfaithful man, but both Ricca and I have been helped by him since our parents passed.=我眼前的男人是一个性欲旺盛、不忠的男人，但自从我们的父母去世，Ricca和我都得到了他的帮助。
Anxiety builds up in my chest. I think back on not just my service tonight, but my interactions with him during the day, looking for why he might be upset with me.=焦虑在我心中滋长。我不仅回想了我今晚的服侍，还回想了我白天和他的互动，想知道他为什么会生我的气。
Hey, Miria... Maybe you should stop worrying about Ricca so much and look after yourself. You'll get burned if you keep playing with fire like this.=内个，Miria…也许你该别再担心Ricca了。好好照顾你自己。你再这样玩火会自焚的。
I-I don't have to think about... I'm doing this for Ricca... I'm seriously worried about her...!=我，我不用考虑这些...我这么做是为了Ricca... 我真的很担心她...！
She still acts like a child... Always so selfish... I can't rely on her for anything, and she wants to be coddled...=她仍然表现得像个孩子...总是那么自私...我什么都不能依赖她，她想被宠爱...
The man who was only a moment ago indulging in pleasure with my body was now lecturing me. I burst at him from the sudden spark of anger.=刚才还沉迷于我的身体的那个人现在正在教训我。我突然勃然大怒，冲他发火。
I'm doing this for Ricca, and... Oh... Oh no... I-I'm so sorry!=我这么做是为了Ricca，和...哦...哦不...我，我很抱歉！
I realize my own hot-headedness and immediately regain composure. I twist my body and continue to send him flirtatious stares.=我意识到自己头脑发热，立刻恢复了镇静。我扭动身体，继续用挑逗的目光盯着他。
Nnn... U-Umm.... A-Are you sure...you had enough...?=嗯...嗯...你，你确定...你够了...？
T-To be honest...I'm...umm...not satisfied yet... I want more of your strong, sturdy cock...=老，老实说...我...我嗯...还不满足...我还想要你强壮坚固的鸡巴...
Uh... No thanks, I'm sure I'm good for today. Ghahaha... Man, I feel old. A pretty girl like you is wasted on me when I finish after one shot...=呃...不用了，谢谢，我今天肯定没问题。哈哈哈...老兄，我觉得自己老了。像你这样漂亮的女孩在我身上打完一枪就浪费了...
...I put the money over there, so you can take that with you.=...我把钱放在那里，你把它带走吧。
Oh... I-I see... Thank you very much...=哦...我明白了...非常感谢你...
Ghahaha... My wife might wake up and find out what we're up to if we're at it for too long... You should head home soon too. Be careful not to catch a cold.=哈哈哈...如果我们干得太久，我妻子可能会醒来发现我们在干什么...你也应该早点回家。小心别感冒。
The merchant opened the door with a creak and headed toward the back room with tired footsteps.=商人吱吱一声把门打开，迈着疲惫的脚步向后面的房间走去。
Judging by the laugh, he must have been joking when he said was too old.=从笑声来看，他说自己太老了，一定是在开玩笑。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Why...? What did I do wrong...? Did he grow tired of me...? Or is his business not doing well because of the monsters...? But I need money for Ricca...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>为什么...？我做错了什么...？他厌倦我了吗...？还是因为怪物的缘故，他的生意做得不好...？但我需要钱给Ricca...)
I don't think I can get any more money from the merchant.=我想我再也不能从商人那里弄到钱了。
Fewer travelers are visiting the village with every passing day because of the monsters.=由于怪物的存在，每天来到这个村庄的游客越来越少。
(<indent%3D0.4em>I want her to live a happy life... I want her to make a wonderful family, like the one we had when Mom and Dad were still alive...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我希望她过上幸福的生活...我想让她成个美好的家，就像我们在爸爸妈妈还活着的时候一样......）
(<indent%3D0.4em>Oh... What should I do...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>哦...我该怎么办...？）
Urk... Oww... *Sniff*... Uugh... Ooow...=呜... 哦...*抽泣*...啊...哦...
In the dark shop, I was struck by a sudden sense of loneliness and worry, and tears fell from my eyes.=在黑暗的商店里，我突然感到孤独和担忧，眼泪从我的双目流了下来。
*Sniff*... Oh... Oww, oww... *Sniff*... Hick...=*抽泣*...哦...呜呜...*抽泣*...嘤嘤...
I stifle my voice as I cry, so as not to let the merchant resting in the back room hear me.=我一边哭一边抑制自己的声音，以免让在后面房间休息的商人听到。
I let the wave of uncontrollable emotions calm down before I wipe off the fluids stuck on my body, put on my crumpled clothes, and clean the floor a little.=我让无法控制的情绪平静下来，然后擦去粘在身上的液体，穿上皱巴巴的衣服，稍微擦了擦地板。
Finally, I signal to the merchant that he may lock his doors, and head back to my house where my unsuspecting sister sleeps.=最后，我向商人发出信号，让他把门锁上，然后返回我的房子，我毫无戒心的妹妹就睡在那里。

Proceed to stage<line-height%3D125%>\r\nChapter 6 The Dwellers of the Dark Forest?=游玩关卡<line-height%3D125%>\r\n第 6 章 黑暗森林的居民？
Chapter 6    The Dwellers of the Dark Forest=第 6 章   黑暗森林的居民
Forest at the Foot of the Mountain=山脚下的森林
<b>Continues</b>\r\n Upon using a continue, you'll lose some of your Magic Stones\r\n and the state of any skills obtained through holy knight memories\r\n will be reset to how they were before passing through the last checkpoint.=<b>继续</b>\r\n 使用检查点继续时，你会失去一些魔法石\r\n 通过圣骑士记忆获得的任何技能状态\r\n 将被重置为最后一个检查点时刻的状态。
Upon grapple defeat by Ghoul\r\n"Ghoul gangbang" \r\nH scene (Already seen)=在被食尸鬼击败后\n“食尸鬼轮奸”\nH场景（已经看过）
The settlement that was attacked by monsters a while ago should be in this forest...=不久前被魔物袭击过的村落应该就在这片森林里...
It's still daytime, but it's quite dark here... Could there be a Drain Crystal around here too?=明明是白天，还这么暗...这里也有导能水晶吗？
If the people here could tell us where the monsters live, it could be a clue... I hope Miria is safe...=如果这里的人能告诉我们怪物住在哪里，只需线索...希望Miria没事...
Have you noticed how sometimes monsters will go spinning away when you attack them?=你有没有注意到，当你攻击魔物的时候，有时会把它们击飞呢？
Yeah. It's amazing how easily the holy knight weapon can blow them away.=是啊。圣骑士的武器能轻而易举地将他们击飞。
If the monster blown away hits another monster and defeats them as well, their magic will fuse together and they'll drop double the Magic Stones.=如果让击飞的魔物撞向别的魔物并二次伤害它们，魔物之间的魔力融合，将掉落双倍的魔法石。
Wow, really?=哇，真的吗？
You can use the same trick with the rocks that goblins throw, too. If you hit it back at the goblin, they'll drop more Magic Stones. It's a little tricky, but you should try it out when you can afford to.=同样的技巧也适用于哥布林扔的石头。如果你回击哥布林，他们会爆出更多魔法石。有点棘手，但能搞就试试。
Hell Beetle=地狱甲虫
Goblin=哥布林
I think you can push and pull this big box in your holy knight form.=这个大箱子...如果你变身成圣骑士，我看是推得动的。
Investigate=侦查
If you stand to either side of a wooden box you find on the ground,\r\nyou can push or pull it in either direction.=如果你站在木箱的侧边，\n可以推拉。
Oh, I can? But it looks so heavy...=啊？是吗？明明很重的样子...
You have a lot more muscle and endurance while you're transformed. That's why you're able to fight monsters with such a big weapon.=变成圣骑士的时候，身体的力量和耐力会被强化。你甚至能用这么大的武器对付怪物。
I wonder what Miria would say if she saw me wielding this thing and fighting monsters...=我好想知道姐姐看到我挥舞着这个东西和怪物搏斗会怎样...
This place... It must be the goblins' campsite.=这个地方...一定是哥布林们的营地。
You mean, this is where the monsters live!? Iris, do you sense Miria... Do you sense anyone?=你是说，这是怪物生活的地方！？Iris，你感觉到Miria...额，你感觉到有人吗？
I don't. I can't feel any human presence here.=我没有，我感觉不到这里有人。
This campsite is pretty small, when I think about the number of monsters that attacked your village.=比起袭击你们村庄的哥布林的数量，这个营地规模太小了。
I see... Alright, then. Let's keep moving and find the settlement.=收到了...那好吧。我便继续前进以找到定居点。
This is the forest settlement...? H-Hey, Iris... Do you sense anyone...?=这是森林定居点...？喂喂，Iris...你感觉到有人么...？
No, it's just as it looks... I can't sense any human life.=不，如你所见...我感觉不到任何人的生命。
Judging by these burnt remains...the settlement must have been destroyed recently. It's been completely burnt to the ground.=从这些烧焦的遗骸来看...定居点最近被摧毁了。完全被烧成了灰烬。
So there's no one here...? But we needed people to tell us where the monsters dwell...=所以这里没有人...？但我们需要有人告诉我们怪物住在哪里...
This isn't anything like what I was told...! I heard that this settlement wasn't hurt too badly from the monster attacks, but it's completely ruined... Did we come here for nothing...!?=这和我被告知的完全不同...！我听说这个营地没有受到怪物的严重袭击，但它已经完全被摧毁了...我们来这里是白来的吗...！？
Calm down. I feel the wicked presence of a Drain Crystal from this direction. If the monsters who attacked your village were Archlich's henchmen, we might find clues near the Crystal.=冷静。我感觉到这个方向有一个邪恶的导能水晶。如果攻击你村庄的怪物是阿奎雷奇的心腹，我们可能会在水晶附近找到线索。
A Drain Crystal... Okay, let's head over there.=导能水晶...好的，我们去那边吧。
Anyway...=无论如何...
What's with that...big blue doll sitting over there...?=这是...坐在那边的蓝色大娃娃...怎么回事...？
That's the rotten corpse of a human.=那是一具腐烂的人类尸体。
H-Human...!? Ro-Rotten...corpse...!? Oh no... Ugh...=人类...！？人的...尸体！？我草...呃…啊...…
Is it that unusual? It must have been a human who lived in this settlement. There's still flesh on it, so this place must have been attacked not too long ago.=有那么不寻常吗？一定是住在这个定居点的人。上面还有血肉，所以这个地方一定是不久前被袭击的。
Eeek! Th-The corpse... I-It's moving...=哎呀！尸尸体...在移动...
That's a ghoul. The magic from the Drain Crystal turned the human's corpse into an undead monster.=那是个食尸鬼。导能水晶的魔法将人类的尸体变成了不死怪物。
The Drain Crystal did that? It made the dead person into a monster...?=是导能水晶造成的吗？它把死人变成了怪物...？
Those things regenerate their rotten bodies as they move around, so they'll easily recover if your attacks aren't strong enough.=这些东西在移动时会再生腐烂的身体，所以如果你的攻击不够强大，它们很容易恢复。
You'll need to strike a powerful blow if you want to defeat them.=如果你想打败它们，你就需要做出有力的打击。
A female...ghost...!?=一个女...鬼!?
Those ghosts are called wraiths. They're monsters made when evil magic accumulates around vengeful human spirits.=那些鬼魂被称为幻影。它们是邪恶魔法聚集在复仇的人类灵魂周围时制造的怪物。
Wraith=幻影
You can't hit them while they're in their ghost form, and they attack by blowing a cold breath that can freeze your soul. You'd better be careful.=当其处于鬼魂形态时，你打不着她，她们会吹一口冷气来攻击你，让你的灵魂冻结。你最好小心点。
I was hoping that...we could find the monsters' base if we asked the people in the settlement...=我希望...如果我们询问营地里的人，我们就能找到怪物的基地...
But not only did those people lose their home and lives...they've been turned into monsters after death! I'm going to crush the cruel monsters who did that to them!=但是这些人不仅失去了家园和生命...他们死后变成了怪物！我要粉碎那些做出这种事的残忍怪物！
Ghehe! It's a human! A human woman! A young female!=嘿嘿！是人类！人类女人！一个年轻的女人！
Huh!?=呵！？
I guess you escaped from our killing spree... Kheck!? You must be the woman our shitty captain was looking for!=我猜你从我们的疯狂杀戮中逃脱了...呵呵！？你一定就是我们那该死的队长要找的女人！
Killing spree...? D-Did you kill the settlement people!?=疯狂杀戮...？你杀了定居点的人吗！？
Khehe, what a plump, sexy body... You look weak, too! You came here alone to get raped, didn't ya!? Khehehe, you nasty perverted slut!=桀桀，多么丰满性感的身体...你看起来也很弱欸！你一个人来这里是想被强奸的，是吗！？桀桀，你这可恶的变态荡妇！
Wha...!?=什么...！？
I-I am not...! I'm not a n-nasty perverted slut!=我，我不是...！我不是讨厌的变态荡妇！
How vulgar... Don't waste your energy worrying about what a dumb goblin says.=多么粗俗...毋费神担心愚蠢的哥布林所言。
B-But...=但，但是...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Ugh... But you got mad when that goblin back at the village mocked you, Iris...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呃...但是当村子里的那个哥布林嘲笑你时，你可是暴怒啊，Iris...）
B-But he's saying really disgraceful things to me... And I can't let him get away with destroying the settlement...=但，但他对我说了一些很不光彩的话...我不能让他破坏定居点而逍遥法外...
Huh!? The goblin ran off...!?=呵！？哥布林跑了...！？
He didn't run in the direction of the campsite we found earlier. I feel evil magic ahead, so it might be a large monster encampment... Let's give him what he wants and follow him.=他没有朝我们之前找到的营地方向跑。我感觉前方有邪恶的魔法，可能有巨型怪物营地...我们，跟着他罢。
Yeah, he might lead us to Miria...!=嗯呐，他可能会带我们找到姐姐...！
That must be...the new holy knight... Is she from that village...?=那一定是...新的圣骑士...她是那个村子的人吗...？
I finally awaken from my long slumber, and that little girl is who you send to face me...? God of Sunlight...you underestimate my power...=我终于从沉睡中醒来，那个小女孩就是你派来面对我的人...？太阳之神...你可真是低估了我的力量...
However, I cannot take any risks... That girl's body will be mine...=然而，我不能冒任何风险...那个女孩的身体将归我...
Hahahaha... I see... So she's this woman's sister... I cannot blame the ignorant goblins for mistaking you for her...=哈哈哈哈...我懂了...她是这个女人的妹妹...我不能责怪无知的哥布林把你错当成了她...
What...? You want to take her place? Hah, the devotion, the self-sacrifice... Your will is just as beautiful as your looks. You're nothing like that whore who deceived me.=什么...？你想代替她吗？哈，奉献，自我牺牲...你的意志和外表一样美丽。你可不像那个骗我的娼妓。
That being the case...=既然如此...
Still, you're only a woman... By nature, a lowly beast that indulges in shallow pleasures.=不过，你只是一个女人...天生是一只沉溺于浅薄享乐的卑微野兽。
I want you to use your sisterly love to bring out the lustful female that dwells in that girl's body...and gift me with a new whore!=我想你用你的姐妹之爱来激发那个女孩体内的女性欲望...然后献上新的一位礼物妓女！
Khekeke! Fool! Idiot! Bumpkin!=桀桀！蠢！愚钝！乡巴佬！
Eeek! Oww... This place is a wreck...=哎呀！哦...这地方一片废墟...
What do you expect when you break things without thinking? You should learn to be more careful.=你不假思索就破坏东西时，还能指望什么？你应该学会更加小心。
I just thought there would be Magic Stones inside...=我以为里面会有魔法石...
Is this a trap the goblins set? I don't think it hurt you that much. What a stupid trick.=这是哥布林设下的陷阱吗？我看这不会对你造成多大伤害。真是愚蠢的把戏。
Eeek! Don't just talk about it! Help me!=哎呀！别只是动嘴！帮我啊！
It's too sturdy for me to break it. It'll stop eventually. Just wait it out.=它太结实了，我打不烂。它最终会停的。只需等等。
I'm so embarrassed. I can't believe I got caught in a trap like that... Do you think there are other traps like that here?=我好尴尬。我竟然被这样的陷阱困住了...这里还有其他类似的陷阱吗？
We're talking about goblins here, so I'm sure there are. You should be able to spot traps if you look closely. Watch out and don't get caught in one again.=我们研究的是这里的哥布林，所以我肯定还会有。如果你仔细观察，你应该能够发现陷阱。小心，别再被夹腿了。

Is that...a fortress...? A tower...?=那是...要塞...？塔么...？
It's very faint...but I feel the presence of human life around this tower. Looks like we were right to follow that goblin.=非常微弱...但我感觉到这座塔周围有人类的存在。看来我们跟踪那个哥布林是对的。
Miria...!=姐姐...！
Khehehe! Human female! I've caught you now!=桀桀！人类女性！我抓到你了！
Well, we already knew this was some kind of trap... Looks like we're surrounded.=呃，我们已经知道这是陷阱...看来我们被包围了。

There are goblin wizards here too.=这里也有哥布林魔法使。
Their magic lets them attack from far away, and once they activate their magic circles, it can't be stopped.=他们可远程发动魔法攻击，一旦他们激活了魔法阵，就无法阻止。
But it takes them a moment to activate their magic, so they're defenseless while they wait. That's your time to attack.=但是魔法需要一段时间来激活，所以趁他们在毫无防备时，你给我进攻就完事了。
Okay. I'll watch out for the magic circles.=可以。我会留意魔法阵的。
Looks like there are two paths ahead - top and bottom.=看起来前面有两条路——上路径和下渠道。
The top path has a lot of monsters, but the bridge on the bottom path is broken in places... Which way should we go?=上面的小径有很多怪物，但是下面渠道的桥有些地方坏了...我们应该走哪条路？

It's incredible power... But even if he is enhanced, he's still just a goblin. Watch his moves closely!=不可思议的力量...但即使得到提升，他仍然只是个哥布林。仔细观察他的一举一动！
Yeah... If Miria is right there, I'm going to get past him no matter what!=是啊...如果姐姐就在那里，我无论如何都要从其尸体踏过去！

Miria... Ugh... You weren't lying... You've told to save my virginity more than once since that day...=姐姐...呃...你没有撒谎...从那天起你不止一次告诉我要保存好我的童贞...
I don't understand why human men are so picky about that...=我不明白为什么人类男人如此挑剔这事儿...
Heehee... Speaking of which, wasn't the God we prayed to that day also picky? The western kingdom doesn't even let non-virgins into their churches! God must be a very strict and capricious being.=嘿嘿...说到这里，我们那天祈祷的上帝不也很挑剔么？西方王国甚至不允许非处女进入教堂！上帝一定是一个非常严格、反复无常的家伙。
...Ugh...=...呃...
Oh... By the way, you're supposed to be God's servant... You're his holy knight or something, right?=哦...顺便说一句，你应该是上帝的仆人...你是他的圣骑士还是什么的，对吧？
I wonder what would happen if God's servant lost her virginity... What humans deem to be her "purity"... He seems very particular about his taste in girls...=我好奇如果上帝的仆人失去童贞会发生什么...人类认为女子之“纯洁”...老天似乎自己对女孩的品味很挑剔...

I've been forced to sit in a torture chair that binds my arms and legs for several minutes now.=我被迫坐在一张拷问椅上，手脚被绑了好几分钟。
The goblins enjoy the sight of me squirming in fear. They open and close their palms right above my skin, just barely tickling me.=哥布林们喜欢看我在恐惧中蠕动。他们在我的皮肤上方开合手掌，只是轻微地挠我痒痒。

I cry out to my sister with her name in hopes that I reach the human part of her remaining in her heart.=我用姐姐的名字向她哭喊，希望我能触及她内心深处的人性部分。
But all the monster Miria does is smile at me and immediately return her gaze to the goblins.=但怪物Miria所做的只是对我微笑，并立即将目光转向哥布林。

Alright, you with the heavy build.=好吧，你身材魁梧。

Heehee... Take good care of my sister♪=嘿嘿...好好照顾我妹妹♪
Among the twenty or so present, Miria choses the fat, giant of a goblin.=在现场20只哥布林中，Miria选择了一个肥胖、巨大的哥布林。
The obese goblin walks between my legs with his erect penis swaying back and forth.=肥胖的哥布林在我两腿之间游走，勃起的阴茎前后摆动。

The mouth of the large goblin is dripping with drool. I can smell the stench from his disgusting mouth.=大哥布林嘴淌着口水。我从它恶心的嘴里闻到股股臭味。
While his member looks small compared to his large body and bulging belly, I can still tell that it's one size larger than a normal goblin's.=他的肉棒相比于他庞大的身体和鼓鼓的肚子显得挺小，但我仍然能看出它比普通的哥布林大一号。
This is terrible... I'm going to be raped by a filthy goblin... It's my first time, too...=害怕...我会被一个肮脏的哥布林强奸...也是我的第一次...

Before I get a chance to know what is going on, the goblin buries his face in between my legs.=在我知道发生了什么事之前，哥布林把脸埋在我两腿之间了。

Huh!? H-Hey...! D-Don't! Stop... Don't spread it open like that...!=呵！？喂，喂...！不，不要！停下来！...别那样把她张开...！
*Shlip...*=*水流声...*
My vagina opens and I hear a sticky, wet sound.=我的阴道打开了，我听到一种黏糊糊的、潮湿的声音。
Eeek...=哎呀...
Ghehehe, your bitch hole looks delicious... Looks like it's even a little wet...!=嘿嘿，你的骚穴看起来真美味...甚至有点湿...！
I don't want to admit it, but I am turned on by the goblins' crude stares, as well as from getting tickled.=我不想承认，但哥布林粗鲁的眼神和持续地挠痒痒让我兴奋。
I desperately twist my body to escape the goblin's hand, but I am only able to move a little due to my restrained limbs.=我拼命地扭动身体试图逃脱哥布林的手，但由于四肢受限，我只能移动一点点。
While I struggle to get away from him, the monster's large mouth approaches my crotch.=当我挣扎着离开他时，怪物的大嘴靠近了我的胯部。
Ack! Nooo... Stop...!=哎呀! 别别别...停下来！
Lick...!=舔...！
Eeeek!=哎呀！
A goblin's tongue is licking the entrance of my vagina.=哥布林的舌头舔着我阴道的入口。
Goosebumps climb up from my lower body. I can feel a raw, warm sensation from my privates.=鸡皮疙瘩从我的下半身往上窜。我能从我的私处感受到一种原始、温暖的感觉。

Urk, uugh... Eek, no... Stop... Aaah... Ugh... Don't do it... Urk...=呃，呜呜...呃, 不要啊...停下来啊...啊... 唔...别搞...哎呀...

(<indent%3D0.4em>That's my...privates... Stop... Don't lick...that spot...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>那是我的...私处...停下来...别舔...那个地方...）

Her beautiful face, her gentle speech, they were all familiar to me, but the woman standing there isn't Miria...=她美丽的脸庞，温柔的话语，我都很熟悉，但站在那里的女人不是姐姐...
Every time that demon utters words, it feels like she is defiling my sister. I can't stand it.=每次那个恶魔说话的时候，我都感觉她在玷污我姐姐。我不能忍受。

*Shlick... Shlick... Shlick...*=*拟音*

The goblin's tongue slips into my vagina.=哥布林的舌头滑进了我的阴道。
When I play with myself in secret, I can't even slip my pinky finger inside myself. Yet right now, his warm, rough tongue is making its way into my vagina.=当我私底下偷偷自己玩弄她时，我的小指都伸不进里面。然而现在，他温暖粗糙的舌头正在进入我的阴道。
The monster's tongue is covered in drool, and my entrance is already a little wet. It easily slips inside me and begins to lick at my inner walls.=怪物的舌头上满是唾液，我的入口已经有点湿了。他很容易滑进我体内，舔我的内壁。
Urk... Ugh... Don't... Don't move it...inside me... Nnngh...=呜呜... 呃...不要，不要...别在我的里面...动来动去...嗯...
Heehee, Ricca... You keep saying you don't want it, but it looks like you're enjoying that goblin's tongue.=嘿嘿，Ricca...你一直说你不想要，但看起来你很喜欢那个哥布林的舌头嘛。
Ngh... Nngh, I'm not enjoying... Nngh... I hate it... Eeek...=嗯...嗯，我不喜欢...嗯...我讨厌它...哎呀...
All I feel at first is horror, but I gradually feel good from getting licked.=一开始我只觉得恐怖，但被舔后我逐渐舒服起来了。
As a response to that sensation, my vagina begins to secrete more slimy juice.=作为回应，我的阴道开始分泌更多粘稠的汁液。
Huff, heh heh! Lady Miria, she's getting even stickier! Can I put it in now!?=呼呼， 呵呵！Miria夫人，她变得越来越粘稠了！我现在能把肉棒放进去吗！？

Hmmm... Could you hold on a little longer? Just until Ricca apologizes...=呃呣呣呣... 你能再等一会儿吗？等到Ricca道歉再搞...

Fine... Looks like I have no choice but to discipline you. I suppose it is my responsibility as your older sister. I was hoping you would say it yourself, though...=草...看来我别无选择，只能惩罚你。我想这是我作为你姐姐的责任。尽管我希望你能自己说...

Nngh... Eeek... Hyaaah...=嗯... 咿咿... 嗨呀啊啊...

Ugh... Ngh... Urk... Sto...p...=呃... 嗯... 唔... 停...下...
*Sizzle, pop... Sizzle, sizzle...*=*嘶嘶，砰...嘶嘶，嘶嘶...*
I know it hurts, but it'll be over soon. Don't move, okay? We don't want to burn your precious pussy...=我知道很痛，但很快就会过去的。别动，好吗？我们不想烧了你宝贵的阴部...
The surface of my pussy stings and feels tingly...=我的阴部表面刺痛，感觉很刺痛...
This posture...makes me feel like a small child being taught how to pee...=这个姿势...让我感觉像一个小孩子被教如何小便...
*Sizzle... Sizzle... Pop... Sizzle, sizzle... Pop...*=*嘶嘶... 嘶嘶... 啪... 嘶嘶， 嘶嘶... 啪...*
The succubus holds her black tail and points its sharp tip at my pubic bone.=魅魔抓住她的黑色尾巴，尖尖地指向我的耻骨。
Shining from the end of the needle tip is a ray of purple light. Popping sounds and white fumes rise as the laser touches my skin.=从针尖末端发出一道紫光。激光接触到我的皮肤时，发出爆裂声和白色烟雾。
Nngh... Tsk... Uugh... Urk... Nnngh..=嗯嗯... 嘶... 呜呜... 呃... 嗯嗯嗯..
*Pop... Sizzle... Sizzle, sizzle... Pop... Sizzle...*=*啪... 嘶嘶... 嘶嘶，嘶嘶... 啪... 嘶嘶...*
Heehee... Nice and smooth...♪=嘿嘿...又优秀又滑溜...♪
When the succubus smiles in satisfaction, the laser from the end of the tail disappears.=魅魔满意地微笑时，尾巴末端的激光消失了。
It might sting for a while, but you'll just have to endure it. I'll get some soothing herbs and make you some ointment later, too.=它可能会刺痛你一段时间，但你必须忍受它。我去买些舒缓药草，稍后再给你做些药膏。
Ugh... Haa... Nngh...=呃... 哈... 嗯...
Heehee, upsy-daisy... I'm done! Go on and take a look.=嘿嘿，没事啦...我完成了！抬起头来看看。
I timidly move my gaze to look at my crotch, tingling from the cold basement air.=我怯懦地移开视线，看着我的胯部，冷冷的地下室空气让我感到刺痛。
Aah... M-My...pussy...=啊...我，我的...阴部...
My thin patch of hair is carefully shaved off by the demon's magic razor.=我薄薄的一片阴毛被恶魔的魔法剃刀小心地剃掉了。
Moreover, her tail laser burns the roots of the hairs. Not a single patch of stubble is left in my public area.=此外，她的尾巴激光会灼伤毛发的根部。我的公共场所连一根胡茬都没留下。
Ugh... Why...did you do...=呃...为什么...你要这么做...
It isn't just my pubic hair that she has shaved and burned the roots of.=她不仅仅剃掉并烧掉我的阴毛。
My arms are lifted up by chains, and she clean-shaves my exposed armpits, too.=我的胳膊被锁链吊起来，她也给我裸露的腋窝刮毛。
Why? Well... I thought being hairless would match your childish personality. That's all.=为什么？这个嘛...我以为无毛风格会符合你孩子气的性格。就是这样。
Hmm... Besides, it's much easier to take care of now, right? You didn't have much hair in the first place, but it looked like you weren't trimming it either...=呵呣...此外，现在照管起来容易多了，对吧？你本来毛发也不多，而且看起来你也没有修剪...
My face flushes and sweat runs down.=我脸面潮红，汗流浃背。
Th-That's... That's none of your business. I'm... I'm an adult. It's natural for me to have some hair... And I was going to trim it when it got a little more noticeable...=那，那...那不关你的事。我是...我是大人了。我有毛发是很自然的...当它更明显时，我会去修剪它的...
Oh, is that so? I'm sorry. My mistake. It's too late, though. You'll be smooth for the rest of your life.=哦，是这样吗？我很抱歉。我的错。但为时已晚。你失去的毛发一辈子都不会再长回来了。
Smooth...for the rest of my life...!?=光秃秃的...常伴我的余生...！？
Huh... Aaahh... Aah... Ugh...=呵... 啊啊... 啊... 额...
She apologizes nonchalantly like she was saying sorry for snatching food.=她漫不经心地道歉，就像在为抢走的食物早已下肚而道歉一样。
I'm speechless at the lack of remorse this demon shows for leaving a permanent mark on my body.=这个恶魔在我身上留下了一个永久性的印记，我说不出话来。
Uugh... Why... Why would you... I can't believe...=啊...为什么...你为什么...我不敢相信...
When hair first started thinly growing in my pubic area, I was confused and disgusted.=当阴毛开始在我的阴部稀疏生长时，我还挺困惑、厌恶的。
But as time passed, I understood that this was a change everyone's body goes through. I thought of it as part of developing into a woman, and it made me happy. I could be just like my older sister, the most beautiful woman in the village.=但随着时间的推移，我明白了这是每个人的身体都会经历的变化。这是成长为女人的一部分，这让我很开心。我可以像我姐姐一样，她是村里最漂亮的女人。
But now, I'll never get the chance to be like her...=但是现在，我再也没有机会像她一样了...
And it was none other than Miria's own hands that had robbed me of that opportunity.=正是姐姐自己的手剥夺了我的机会。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Miria... No... This isn't her... The person in front of me...is a demon...! My sister Miria would never...do something like this...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>姐姐...不...这不是她...我前面的那个人...是恶魔...！我姐姐Miria永远不会...这样做...）
Now that we're ready...I'll give you the present I mentioned at the top of the tower.=现在我们准备好了...我会给你我在塔顶时提到的礼物。
Present...!? N-No... Don't do anything else to me... Uugh...=礼物...？别...别对我做任何坏事了...啊...
The demoness smiles with Miria's face.=恶魔带着Miria的脸微笑。
Terrible things come with that smile. Rape by goblins, getting my butt wiped in a disgraceful posture, permanent removal of my pubic and armpit hair...=可怕的事情总伴随着那个微笑而来。被哥布林强奸，以可耻的姿势擦屁股，永久性地去除阴毛和腋毛...
I know whatever present she has is going to be even more trouble.=我知道不管她有什么礼物都会变得更麻烦。
*Slip... Slip...*=*拟音*
Nngh...ghh... The tail...again...!? No... Don't come near me...=嗯...啊...尾巴...又来了？!不...别靠近我...
Heehee... I'm going to draw a nice mark on your stomach with this... Aaah♪=嘿嘿...我要用这个在你的肚子上画个漂亮的记号...啊♪
The succubus grabs the tip of her wiggling tail and moans erotically.=魅魔抓住她摆动的尾巴尖，发出性感的呻吟。
The round swollen tip of the succubus' tail seems to be her erogenous zone.=魅魔尾巴上肿胀的圆形尖端似乎是她的敏感带。
Stop... I don't want...a mark on my tummy...=停...我不想...在肚子上有个记号...
The demons I read about in stories and the mages who occasionally visited my village used spells by drawing magic circles with complicated patterns.=我在故事中读到的恶魔和偶尔造访我村庄的法师会使用魔法，用复杂的图案画出魔法阵。
Even with the little magic knowledge I have, it is clear to me that the pattern the succubus is preparing to draw is some kind of curse.=尽管我对魔法知之甚少，但我很清楚魅魔准备画的图案是某种诅咒。
*Chuckle* This wonderfully naughty spell is sure to fix your tomboyish ways...=*咯咯笑*，这个神奇的淫秽咒语一定会改变你的假小子作风喽...
She moves the needle on the tip of her tail to my lower abdomen.=她把尾巴尖上的针头移到我的下腹。
The position is just above my uterus.=这个位置就在我子宫上方。
*Crackle... Crackle crackle crackle...!*=*噼啪声...噼啪噼啪...*
The succubus squints and exhales a soft sigh, and purple light gathers at the tip of the needle. It starts to emit heat while making a succession of popping sounds.=魅魔眯着眼，轻轻地叹了口气，紫色的光聚集在针尖上。发出一连串爆裂声，同时开始发热。
Oww...! It's hot...!=哦呜呜...！好热...！
The heat is so intense, I can feel it indirectly.=热得厉害，我能间接地感觉到。
The tip of her tail, which is  now red, is a branding iron emitting obscene magical energy.=她的尾巴尖现在是红色的，像一块烙铁，散发着淫秽的魔法能量。
It's going to hurt more... No, it's going to be hotter than when I burned your hair off...but you'll just have to put up with it♪=会更疼的...不，会比我把你的毛发烧掉的时候更热...但你必须忍住♪
Wh-What are you...=你，你在干什么...
*Sizzzzzzle...!*=*嘶嘶作响...！*
Before I can finish speaking, I am struck with intense pain.=我还没说完，就感到一阵剧痛。
Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!=嗨呀啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...!=疼，疼，疼...！
The magic branding iron presses against the skin of my lower abdomen, right between my belly button and genitals.=魔力烙铁贴在我的小腹皮肤上，即在我的肚脐和生殖器之间。
Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Owwwwww... It burns, it buuuuuuuuuurns!=哎呀呀呀呀呀呀！哦呜呜呜呜...燃烧，烧起来了！
The scorching light burns my skin. Smoke from the moisture and surface layer of my fried skin rises into the air.=灼热的光线灼伤了我的皮肤。我被炸焦的皮肤及其水分变成烟上升到空气中。
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh... Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!=啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊... 呱呱啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊!
The branding iron slowly moves from the center of my tummy to its side, leaving burn marks on the skin.=烙铁慢慢地从我的腹部中心移动到侧面，在皮肤上留下烧伤痕迹。
Stop it, it burns...! Aaaaaaaah...! Grrrrrrrhhhhh... It's too hot... Aaaaaa, aaagh, owww, it hurts... Make it stop!=住手，烧起来了...！啊啊啊...！咕咕咕哈啊啊...太热了...啊啊，啊啊，哦呜呜，好痛...让它停下来！
My wounds do not bleed, but my scorched inner skin is exposed. The succubus' magical carvings shine with a purplish-red glitter.=我的伤口没有流血，但我焦灼的内层皮肤暴露了出来。魅魔的魔法雕刻闪耀着紫红色的光芒。
Aaaah, stop, Ricca... I'll mess up the pattern if you keep moving. You want it to look pretty, don't you?=啊，停下，Ricca...如果你继续乱动，我会把图案弄乱的。你也想让它看起来美观而漂亮，不是吗？
I don't care how it looks!=它看起来怎么样与我无关！
It hurts and it burns! I'm gonna die... It's going to burn a hole in my tummy...!=疼，而且灼伤！我要死了...会在我肚子上烧个洞的...！
Hurry, make it stop... Please, make it stop!=快点，让它停下来...求你了，让它停下来！
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life constantly cumming...?=你真的想在你的余生中不断地高潮...？
Constantly cumming...? As in, I'll be having an orgasm that lasts my lifetime...?=不断地高潮...？也就是说，我会有一个持续一生的高潮...？

Nnggeeeeek! Aaaaaaagh! Constantly...cumming!? Nnnnngggggh... That's the curse...!? No... I don't want that! Stoooooooop!=嗯咿咿呃！啊啊啊啊！不断地高潮！？嗯咿咿... 这是诅咒...！？不...我不想那样！停下来！
Suddenly, the tip of the needle moves away from my stomach.=突然，针尖离开了我的腹部。
The scorching pen's unfinished spell glows with red light, pulsating with my racing heartbeat.=灼热的“笔”未完成的咒语闪烁着红光，我的心急速跳动。
Hey! I told you to stop moving! If you let me carve the pattern properly, you won't have to cum all your life!=喂！我告诉过你不要动！如果你让我正确地雕刻图案，你就不必一辈子都高潮了！
My body freezes from the sight of the angry succubus.=目睹魅魔的愤怒，我的身体吓得僵住了。
Her expression is completely serious.=她的表情非常严肃。
That was the face Miria made when she earnestly scolded me for doing something dangerous. I hadn't seen that face in years.=这是Miria真的发火，骂我做了危险的事时的表情。我好多年没见过那张脸了。
Does that mean...this monster is actually worried about me?=这是不是说...这个怪物真的很担心我？
Even in this demonic form, does my real sister's heart remain somewhere?=即使是在这种恶魔的形态，我真正的姐姐的心是否仍在某个地方？
Ooow... I-I can't believe in...the words...of a demon... *Sniff*... Please... *Sniff*... Quit doing these things...=哦哦...我，我真不敢相信...一个恶魔的...话...*抽泣*...求你了...*抽泣*...停止做这些事...
The sight of the angry demoness strikes fear in me and tears leak out.=看到愤怒的恶魔，我感到恐惧，眼泪流了出来。
At the same time, I become awfully sad. The pain in my chest is incomparable to the burns on my tummy.=与此同时，我变得非常悲伤。我胸口的疼痛和肚子上的灼伤是无法比拟的。
I never wanted to see Miria make that face again... I want to always see her with a gentle smile...=我再也不想看到Miria做那表情了...我想永远看到她温柔的微笑...
*Sniff*... *Sniff*... Ugh... Hick... Just... Stop...=*抽泣*... *抽泣*... 呃... 嘤嘤...就...停下吧...

If my sister's heart is still left in this demon, surely she'll embrace me gently and comfort me...=如果我姐姐的心还留在这个恶魔身上，她一定会温柔地拥抱我，安慰我...
Geez... I don't care if you believe me or not... But staring at me like that isn't going to stop me...=天哪...我不管你信不信...但那样盯着我看并不能阻止我...
If you still have Miria's soul, please stop being angry...=如果你还有Miria的灵魂，请不要生气...
Even if she turned into a demon, as long as she has her gentle soul, I don't want to anger Miria... I don't want to make her sad...=即使她变成了恶魔，只要她有温柔的灵魂，我就不想让Miria生气...我不想让她难过...
Because I know that she only gets mad at me when I worry her...=因为我知道只有当我让她担心时，她才会生我的气...

Miri...a...=姐...姐...
*Sizzzzle... Sizzle...*=*嘶嘶...嘶嘶...*
Why...? I apologized properly...!=为什么...？我明明好好地道歉了...！
The needle tail presses against the skin on my lower abdomen once again. It begins to carve the spell with its magic branding iron.=针头的尾巴再次压在我下腹的皮肤上，开始用魔法烙铁雕刻咒语。
Ricca, please don't struggle...This will end soon as long as you stay still!=Ricca，请不要挣扎...只要你一动不动，一切就会马上结束喽！
My waist struggles to escape from the burning needle, but it can't move from the firm grip of the succubus.=我的腰挣扎着从滚烫的针头中逃脱，但在魅魔的紧握下无法移动。
The woman's slender arms are unbelievably strong. Her long, supple fingers dig into the flesh of my tummy.=这女人纤细的手臂难以置信地强壮。她柔软的长手指伸进了我的肚子里。
Nnggggh...! Haaaaaaa... Let me go... Aaaaaagh...=嗯嗯...! 哈啊啊啊... 放开我...啊啊啊...
Stop, I said quit moving...!=住手，我说别动了...！
Ooooooooooooh... Aaaaaaagh!=哦哦哦...啊啊啊啊啊啊！
I think about twisting my body more and struggling.=我想尽量扭曲我的身体以挣扎。
The holy power in my brooch gives me extra strength, so I may be able to push off the fingers digging into my tummy.=胸针中的神圣力量给了我额外的气力，所以我也许能推开扣我肚的指头。
Eeeeek... Aaaaaaagh, haaa, haaa... Aaagh... Aah... Aaaaaaaaah!=哎呀.. 啊啊啊，哈，哈啊... 啊啊啊... 啊... 唉啊啊啊！
But as long as my body is restrained, I can't escape the branding iron, and I'm worried about what might happen if the succubus messes up the spell, as she had warned.=但只要我的身体受到约束，我就无法逃脱烙铁的烙印，我担心如果像魅魔警告的那样扰乱了咒语，会发生的事情。

The touch and warmth I feel from the fingers under the gloves...=我从手套下的手指感受到的触摸和温暖...
Miria's desperate expression... I've never seen her like this before...=Miria绝望的表情...我从没见过她这样...
The way her arm keeps gripping my tummy, even while it trembles from muscle cramps, deprives me of the will to resist.=她的手臂一直抓着我的肚子，即使它因肌肉抽筋而颤抖，这让我失去了抵抗的意志。
Haaa, aaagh... Nnnhaaa.... Aaaah... Hhngh, eeek... Haaa... Haaaaaaa...=哈，啊啊... 嗯哈.... 啊啊啊... 呵嗯，咿咿... 哈... 哈啊啊啊...
Oh, my... Nnh... Heehee, good girl... Hm... Just stay still like that...=哦，天哪...嗯...嘿嘿，好女孩...就这样别动...
Nngh, ghhh, aaaah... Nngh, nnh... Haaaaaa... Haaaaaa...=嗯，咕嗯呃，啊啊啊... 呃，嗯嗯... 哈啊啊啊... 哈啊啊啊...
The engraving of the curse picks up the pace after I stop resisting, and I start to see the complete pattern.=在我停止抵抗后，诅咒的雕刻加快了速度，我得以看到完整图案。
Engraved onto my lower abdomen is an inverted triangle, plainly resembling a human womb.=我的小腹上刻着一个倒三角形，很像人类的子宫。
Nnh, nngh... Haa, haa... Aaaaaagh, ghh, aaahhh... Haa...=嗯，嗯呃... 哈，哈... 啊啊啊， 呃，啊呵呵啊... 哈啊...

The marking glows red with the beat of my heart, but that light is much stronger than before.=标记随着我的心跳发出红色的光芒，但那光芒比以前更强烈了。

My body feels hot...=我的身体感觉很热...
I strange sensation comes from inside me.=我内心有一种奇怪的感觉。
It becomes hard and painful for me to breathe...=呼吸变得又困难又痛苦...
(<indent%3D0.4em>What...is this feeling...? It's not just pain... The curse marking feels hot... No, it's not just that, either... The area below the marking tingles too...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>这是...什么感觉...？不仅仅是痛苦...诅咒印记感觉很烫...不，也不仅仅如此...标记下方的区域也会刺痛...）

The burning heat fades away, and the sound of scorching skin stops.=灼热消退，灼烤皮肤的声音停止。
Haa... Nngh... Nnnh... Aaaaah... Haaa...=哈... 嗯... 嗯嗯... 啊啊... 哈...
The carving turned out beautiful since you were such a good girl! Take a look... Heehee♪=因为你真是个好女孩，所以这雕刻看起来很漂亮！看一看吧...嘿嘿♪
The demoness smiles just like when she permanently removed my hair a few minutes ago.=恶魔的微笑与几分钟前她永久性地剪掉我的毛发时的一样。
Seeing the recomposed succubus' face makes me sweat, and sickly wet hair sticks to my forehead and cheeks.=看到魅魔镇定的脸让我汗流浃背，湿漉漉的头发粘在额头和脸颊上。
(<indent%3D0.4em>My, tummy... Aah... Every time...this pink marking...glows...it tingles... It's shaped like...the place for babies...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我的肚子...啊...每一次...这个粉红色的标记...发光...就刺痛...形状像是...婴儿的房间...）
I recall what I saw in a human anatomy book left unsold at the general store. It had a diagram of the organ made for carrying children.=我还记得在杂货店里一本没卖的人体解剖学书里看到的。里面有一个器官图，怀着婴儿的形态。
Hey... Do you know what this is shaped like?=喂...你知道这是什么形状吗？

The shape will disappear soon, but don't worry. It'll come right back when the goblins rape you!=这个形状很快就会消失，但别担心。当哥布林强奸你的时候它就会回来！
The smiling demon takes her hand off her tail, and lightly strokes my scars with her fingers.=微笑的恶魔把手从尾巴上拿开，用手指轻轻抚摸我的伤疤。

After the demon strokes the whole scar with her finger, she covers the entire marking with her hand.=在恶魔用手指划过整个伤疤后，她用手覆盖了整个伤疤。
(<indent%3D0.4em>What is she...going to do...? Urk... I don't...want to get...hurt anymore...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>她...打算做什么...？呜呜...我再也不...想...疼了...）
Heehee... Don't be so scared...=嘿嘿...别那么害怕...
Her gloved hand emits red, pulsing light from the palm. My marking then sucks in the light and glows in the same color.=她戴着手套的手从手掌发出红色的脉冲光。然后，我的标记吸收了光线，并以相同的颜色发光。
Aah, nngh... What, is this... My tummy... It's twisting and... Haaaah... It feels good...? Why...? Aaah...=啊啊，嗯... 这是，咋了...我的肚子...在扭曲...并且...感觉很爽...？为什么？啊...
Every time my mark absorbs red light, it feels like the organs underneath my scars are churned.=每次我的疤痕吸收红光时，我感觉疤痕下面的器官都在翻腾。
Yet that feeling does not come with pain, but a pleasurable throbbing sensation that crawls up my spine.=然而，这种感觉并非伴随着疼痛，而是一种爬上我脊柱的愉悦悸动感。

The succubus' hand shines brightly for a moment.=魅魔的手闪耀了片刻。

Aaaaaaah, I-I'm gonna break! Aaah, my womb, nnnngh, it's gonna breaaaaaak!=啊啊啊，我，我要崩溃了！啊，我的子宫，她要坏掉了！
The marking's light gradually weakens, but then glows brightly like a candle just before it burns out.=标记的光线逐渐减弱，但在熄灭前，它像蜡烛一样发出明亮的光。
At the same time, my mind goes white, and my body bends backward from the current of pleasure coming from my womb.=同时，我的头脑一片空白，我的身体因我腹中之乐，也向后弯曲。

Hey, Ricca... What do you think of my present? Do you like it?=那个，Ricca...你觉得我的礼物怎么样？你喜欢吗？
The succubus asks me with delight while I'm still immersed in the pleasure of climax.=当我仍沉浸在高潮的喜悦中时，魅魔高兴地问我。
The Crest of Lust... This is a magic spell succubi use to dominate humans.=欲望羽冠...一个女妖用来统治人类的魔法。
Apart from the heart-shaped center, the womb-patterned burn marks on Ricca have disappeared. The only trace left of the carefully carved uterus and ovaries is a faint bruise.=除了心形的中心，Ricca上子宫图案的烧伤痕迹已经消失。被仔细雕刻的子宫和卵巢，留下的唯一痕迹是一处轻微的瘀伤。
When Ricca returns from the white wonderland in her mind, the succubus Miria proudly explains the effects of the curse.=当Ricca从她心中的白色仙境归来时，魅魔Miria自豪地解释了诅咒的效果。
According to her, the curse is powered by the victim's magic and works to keep the female body in a constant state of heat. The effect of the curse is proportional to the size of the marking.=据她说，诅咒由受害者的魔法驱动，可以让女性身体保持恒定的高温状态。诅咒的效果与标记的大小成正比。
The effect of the Crest of Lust also increases when it nears the magic of monsters.=当接近怪物的魔力时，欲望羽冠的效果也会增强。
In other words, the marking will activate when the female's mucous membrane comes in contact with a monster's, or when parts of her body like her genitals, intestine, or mouth touch semen. It'll then return to the shape it was originally carved in.=换句话说，当雌性的粘膜与怪物的粘膜接触时，或者当她的身体部位，如生殖器、肠道或口腔接触精液时，标记就会激活。然后它会恢复到最初雕刻的形状。
And when the scars grow red and regain their original form, the crest will truly be completed.=当伤疤变红并恢复其原始形状时，纹章将真正完成。
Ricca shudders.=Ricca浑身发抖。
While the demoness happily explains the effects of the curse, her lower abdomen achingly shakes, and her labia drips with slimy juice.=当恶魔高兴地解释诅咒的效果时，她的小腹疼痛地颤抖，阴唇滴下粘稠的汁液。
In addition, getting raped by the monsters would further strengthen the curse.=此外，被怪物强奸会进一步强化诅咒。
The marking currently glows with 20 or 30 percent of its power, but she can't imagine how sexually excited she'll become when the crest is fully activated.=目前，这个标记能发挥20%或30%的效果，但她无法想象当纹章完全激活时，她会变得多么性兴奋。
Haaa... Haaa... Urk... How could you give me such a thing...?=哈啊... 哈啊... 呜呜... 你怎么能赋予我这样的东西...？
Ricca is frozen in shock, but the demon continues her explanation to rub more salt in her wound.=Ricca吓得僵住了，但恶魔继续解释，在她的伤口上擦了更多的盐。
She says that in proportion to the size of the crest, Ricca's erogenous zones will develop and enlarge, and her sweat and urine will emit an obscene smell that will fan the flames of male lust.=她说，与诅咒的大小成比例，Ricca的敏感带会发展和扩大，她的汗水和尿液会散发出一种淫秽的气味，会激起男性欲望的火焰。
As the curse develops, her entire body will be able to feel sexual pleasure, and her real erogenous zones will become ten times more sensitive than the norm.=随着诅咒的发展，她的整个身体都能感受到性快感，她真正的性感带将变得比正常情况敏感十倍。
Ricca's body will transform into a more feminine figure, her breasts will swell, and they'll spray milk from sexual pleasure.=Ricca的身体女性化特征会更显著，乳房会膨胀，会从性快感中喷出奶。
The milk will be heavy in magic to ensure her monster babies will grow strong and healthy.=奶将充满魔力，以确保她的怪物宝宝茁壮成长。
When the crest takes its complete form, Ricca's womb will never be able to conceive a human child, and it will instead transform into a reproductive organ dedicated to producing baby monsters of all kinds.=当诅咒完全成形时，Ricca的子宫将永远无法怀上人类的孩子，相反，它将变成一个生殖器官，专门生产各种各样的怪物婴儿。
And by showering the ovaries with powerful magic, they'll ovulate their ova and be ready to conceive monsters at any given time.=通过向卵巢注入强大的魔力，她们将排卵，并随时准备怀孕。
O... Ova...? Ovulation...?=排...卵？排卵...？
That's right. Ova are the eggs in your stomach that turn into babies.=是啊。卵子像是腹中的蛋，会变成婴儿喽。
And when a penis releases its semen inside you...the little tadpoles inside the white liquid gang up on the ovum and try to go inside it...=当阴茎在你体内释放精液时...白色液体中的小蝌蚪聚集在卵子上，试图进入其中...
The succubus continues to spout knowledge the naive village girl couldn't comprehend, but Ricca realizes that she is listening to meaningless details.=魅魔继续滔滔不绝地说着天真的乡村女孩无法理解的知识，但Ricca意识到她在听毫无意义的细节。
I used every spell effect I could think of in your curse. That's why it took a while to engrave. I'm sorry I made you go through that pain for so long♪=我在你的诅咒中使用了我能想到的所有咒语。故而雕刻花了一段时间。很抱歉我让你经历了这么长时间的痛苦♪
But thanks to you holding still, I was able to carve it beautifully! Heeheehee...♪=但多亏你一动不动，我才把它刻得很漂亮！嘿嘿...♪
While the curse was being engraved into Ricca, Miria was gripping her stomach as it struggled and writhed in pain.=当咒语刻在Ricca身上时，Miria紧紧抓住她的肚子，不顾她的痛苦挣扎。
Ricca noticed traces of her sister in the demon's grip and serious face, and so she stopped moving. But after seeing the succubus' smirk, she regretted ever letting her carve the curse into her.=Ricca注意到恶魔抓着她姐姐的蛛丝马迹和严肃的脸，所以她停止了挣扎。但在看到魅魔的假笑后，她后悔让她把诅咒刻在自己身上了。
Haaa... Nnngh... Haaa... Haaa...=哈啊... 嗯嗯... 哈啊... 哈啊...
My body is hot... My pussy is burning, and it tingles every time the air strokes it.=身体好热...阴部在燃烧，每次空气吹拂都会刺痛。
I'm hung upside down now, but my embarrassing juices are going against gravity. They won't stop overflowing...=我现在倒挂着，但我尴尬的汁水正逆流而上。不停地泛滥...
Ricca, it looks like you're in a lot of pain... But I have to put the goblin sex on hold...=Ricca，看起来你很痛苦...但我必须暂停你与哥布林的性爱...
Slip... Slip...=滑... 滑...
The succubus' black gloves stroke the indecent marking on my lower abdomen.=魅魔的黑手套抚摸着我下腹的不雅标记。
Every time her gentle fingertips move, my vagina is struck by an aching sensation like it's being licked.=每次她温柔的指尖移动，我的阴道都会有一种被舔的疼痛感。
Nnnh, haaa... I'm not hoping... Nnngh... To get raped...=嗯，哈...我不希望...嗯...被强奸...
I don't want to get raped by those disgusting, loathsome goblins.=我不想被那些恶心讨厌的哥布林强奸。
And if what the succubus says is true, my curse is going to activate, and I'm sure to conceive a baby.=如果魅魔说的是真的，我的诅咒就会激活，我肯定会怀孕。
Yet, my body and my mind are at odds with each other...=然而，我的身体和我的思想是相互矛盾的...
Heehee, you're lying again... Your pussy's drooling all over. It's so hungry for cock, it's practically begging for it...=嘿嘿，你又在撒谎了...你的小穴流着汁水。它太渴望肉棒了，简直是在乞求肉棒...
But if you cum now, the spell I just carved into you might go out of control.=但是如果你现在高潮，我刚才刻在你身上的咒语可能会失控。
I'll have to ask you to be patient until the marking settles. You don't want to orgasm your sanity away, do you?=我得请你耐心一点，直到伤口愈合。你不想因为性高潮让你失去理智吧？
Orga... Nngh, my sanity...? Nngh... Haa...=性高... 呃，我的理智...？嗯...哈...
*Schlick...*=*拟音...*
I recall how I came from the goblin's penis, and I feel the inner depths of my pussy release even more fluids.=我回忆起我是如何从哥布林的阴茎中走出来的，我感觉我的阴部深处释放出更多的液体了。
If that does happen, I'll look after you, but...I don't think mindless girls are these monsters' type...=如果真是这样，我会照顾你的，但是...我不认为没有头脑的女孩是这些怪物的类型...
Master Archlich said it's fine as long as you're alive, but as your sister, I prefer to hand you over after you've been properly disciplined.=阿奎雷奇主人说只要你还活着就好，但作为你的姐姐，我更乐意在你得到适当训练后把你交出去。
Heehee... You can be trained to his liking after I present you to him, anyway...=嘿嘿...不管怎样，等我把你介绍给他后，你就可以按他的喜好训练了...
Archlich... That's the evil wizard from the fairy tale Iris told me about.=阿奎雷奇...是Iris告诉我的童话故事中的邪恶巫师。
When I became a holy knight, he became my enemy. He's the monster who's been manipulating the goblins.=我成为圣骑士时，他便成了我的敌人。他就是那个操纵哥布林的怪物。
And he's most likely the person who turned my sister into a demon.=他很可能就是那个把我姐姐变成恶魔的人。
Hearing my enemy's name from this mad succubus' mouth awakens the anger in me.=从这个疯狂的魅魔嘴里听到我敌人的名字，我心中的愤怒被唤醒了。
I-I promise I'm going to...drive out the demon inside you, Miria...=我保证我会...赶走你内心的恶魔，姐姐...
*Snap!*=*啪！*
An intense shock of pleasure shoots through me from my crotch.=一种强烈的快感从我的胯部袭来。
My erect clitoris had been struck with a powerful flick by the gloved hand of the demoness.=我勃起的阴蒂被戴着手套的恶魔的手有力地拨弄了一下。
Nnnheeek... Haa, nngh, haaa... Haaa... Heehee...=嗯嗯咿咿... 哈啊，嗯嗯，哈哈啊... 哈啊... 嘻嘻...
A strong flick like that should have hurt, but it felt good...=像那样强烈的一击本该很痛，但感觉很爽...
It feels good... I like it...but it isn't enough...=感觉很爽...我喜欢...但这还不够...
The pleasure paired with aching sadness wilts away.=快乐与痛苦的悲伤一起枯萎。
With it, the fiery anger in my heart burns out.=有了它，我心中炽烈的愤怒燃烧殆尽。
Heehee, you almost came from your sensitive clit, didn't you? But you didn't cum...=嘿嘿，你差点就从你敏感的阴蒂高潮了，不是吗？但你没有高潮...
You can't orgasm while I have my hand over your curse mark. That's why I can...=当我把手放在你的诅咒印记上时，你不能达到高潮。故而我可以...
...flick you over and over...=...一次又一次地拨弄你...
...and you still won't cum♪=...但你还是不会高潮♪
Haa... Haa... Stop it... No more...=哈... 哈... 住手...不要再...
*Snap! Snap! Snap!*=*啪！啪！啪！*
My hips shake and tremble, and my pussy squirts huge volumes of fluids.=我的臀部颤抖，阴部喷出大量液体。
The liquid falls onto my face and hair. I feel like I'm going dizzy from my own indecent scent.=液体落在我的脸上和头发上。自己的不雅气味让我头晕。

What am I thinking...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我的背...没颤抖...不像往常一样...如果她再用力捏我一下...用她的手指再拨弄我...不...我为什么要...像那样高潮...我在想什么...？）

Hmm... Heehee. Now, then... Let's start on the other half, shall we?=呵呣呣... 呵呵...现在，然后...让我们从另一半边开始，好吗？

Nnnghaaa, nnhaaaan... My womb, feels soooo gooood... You shouldn't be that deep in me, but... Aaaaah...=嗯，嗯，嗯...我的子宫感觉很舒服...你不应该对我那么深，但是...啊啊...
You might not be listening...but I'll tell you anyway.=你可能没在听...但我还是要告诉你。
That drug I injected into the entrance of your uterus has the ability to reshape nerve cells.=我注射到你子宫入口的药物有重塑神经细胞的能力。
It looked like it wasn't working well, so I had to inject a lot of it... But unlike the magic curse, this can't be undone anymore.=看起来效果不太好，所以我不得不注射了很多...但与魔法诅咒不同的是，这不能再被撤销了。

The succubus' needle tail enters my uterus entrance, which is now more sensitive than my clitoris. It wiggles and pushes its way through.=魅魔的针状尾巴进入我的子宫入口，现在比我的阴蒂更敏感。它扭动并推动它通过。
D-Don't move like that! Not so deep! Aaaah! Don't move so much...inside me! It feels too good! Hyaa! Nyoooo<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>=别那样动！别那么深！啊！不要在我里面...动个不停！太舒服了！嗨呀! Nyoooo<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>
Since most of my power to think has been swept away by the pleasure, I don't notice that I have been moaning sweetly.=由于我的大部分思考能力都被快感冲走了，我没有注意到我一直在甜蜜地呻吟。
Still, I try to twist and escape from the wiggling tail in my womb entrance, but my body only has strength enough for me to weakly shake my hips.=尽管如此，我还是试图从子宫入口处摆动的尾巴中扭动和逃脱，但我的身体只剩下力量让我无力地摇晃臀部。
While I struggle, the swollen tip of the tail keeps pushing against my entrance, spreading my womb open with its coned needle.=当我挣扎时，肿胀的尾巴尖不断地推着我的入口，用它的锥形针头将我的子宫张开。

The tip of the tail firmly presses against my narrow uterus opening and enters it in one strong push, but the momentum causes it to pierce into my womb's innermost wall.=尾巴的尖端紧紧地压在我狭窄的子宫口上，用力一推就进入了子宫，但这种冲力使它刺穿了我子宫的最内壁。
The stimulation fires flickers of light in my eyes. My mind goes completely white from pleasure...=这种刺激在我的眼睛里闪烁着光芒。我的大脑因快感而变得完全苍白...
Cumming... I'm cumming...! Khaaaaaaa... Nnghaaa... Haa...haa... I can't cum... No... I hate this... Nnngh... Haa...=去了...我要去了...！咳哈哈啊... 嗯哈啊啊... 哈...哈... 我无法高潮...啊...我讨厌这样...嗯...哈...
I can't cum... I want to cum... I thought I was finally going to cum...=我无法高潮...我想高潮...我以为我终于要高潮了...
The sense of approaching orgasm gradually fades away. The crest under the succubus' hand is absorbing it from my body.=接近性高潮的感觉逐渐消失。魅魔手下的纹章正从我身上吸收感觉。

Yet my body still seeks relief. My vagina shakes and aches as it instinctively clenches on the demon's tail.=然而，我的身体仍在寻求解脱。当我本能地紧握恶魔的尾巴时，我的阴道会颤抖和疼痛。

Really...begins...? Y...You mean...there's more...?=真正的开始...？你是说...还有更多...？

It is a sign that the magic branding iron used on my skin is emerging again.=这是用在我皮肤上的魔力烙铁再次出现的迹象。

Hehe... I wonder which sensation will win? Pain or pleasure? Maybe it's pain since you aren't able to cum...=呵呵...我想知道哪种感觉会赢？痛苦还是快感？也许这是因为你无法高潮...
Haa, hot... Inside... Haaa, ack... It burns...=哈，热...在...体内...哈哈，啊...在燃烧...
Her gloved left hand strokes the Crest of Lust engraved above my womb.=她戴着手套的左手抚摸着刻在我子宫上方的欲望羽冠。
Her palm emits a faint glow of red light.=她的手掌发出微弱的红光。
I'll send magic into you through here to keep you from moving...=我会通过这里给你输入魔法阻止你乱动...
Heehee, it's okay if you wet yourself. I'll just have mister slime lick it and wipe you clean again, so I don't mind if you pass out.=嘿嘿，如果你把自己弄湿了没关系。我会让史莱姆先生舔一下，再把你擦干净，所以我不介意你昏倒。

The demoness pulls her tail out of my vagina, leans over, and places her right hand on my face.=恶魔把她的尾巴从我的阴道里拉出来，俯身，把右手放在我的脸上。

Hyeeeeh... Haaheeeeh...?=呵邪呃... 哈呵呵...?
The hand brings back memories buried deep in my mind. I recall how it helped me stop crying when I got lost in the mountains when I was little.=这只手让我想起了深深埋藏在我脑海中的记忆。我记得小时候在山里迷路时，是帮助我停止哭泣的手。
I've been tricked by her many times already...but maybe my sister is still somewhere in her soul...=我已经被她骗过很多次了...但也许我姐姐还在她的灵魂深处...
Ricca... You can do it♪=Ricca...你能行♪
I know that...demons are good at deceiving humans, but...=我知道...恶魔擅长欺骗人类，但是...

The tail in my vagina's path squirms and the hot needle at its tip glides against my inner walls as it burns the membrane.=我阴道里的尾巴蠕动着，针尖上的热针头在我的内壁上滑动，它会灼伤阴道膜。
Eeeeeeeeeeekkk! It burns! It burns! It buuuurns!=哎呀！烧起来了！烧起来了！烧起来了！
The gem on my necklace brooch radiates and relieves the burning pain just slightly, but even divine protection can't save me from mind-numbing agony.=我项链胸针上的宝石放射出光芒，只是稍微缓解了灼痛，但即使是神圣力量的保护也无法将我从麻木的痛苦中拯救出来。

The demon's tail wiggles inside me to draw the pattern. The orgasmic pleasure from my vagina and womb continues to assault me.=恶魔的尾巴在我体内摆动来画出图案。来自阴道和子宫的性高潮继续折磨着我。

Aaaaaaagh! I'm gonna break! Stooooop! My tummy! It's gonna melt!! Eeeek! Oooooooowwww!!=啊啊啊！我要崩溃了！停下！我的肚子！会融化的！！哎呀！呜呜呜呜！！
The intense pain from the uterus, and overwhelming pleasure right under it...=子宫的剧烈疼痛，以及子宫下的巨大快乐...
Both sensations are strong enough to make me faint, but they are polar opposites of each other.=这两种感觉都很强烈，足以让我晕倒，但它们是截然相反的。
The nerves in my body become confused, forcing the immobile muscles in my body to move, causing me to convulse.=我体内的神经变得混乱，迫使我体内静止的肌肉移动，导致我抽搐。

The Crest of Lust... Is it the work of the demon lady...? So that's why she's been acting odd...=欲望羽冠...这是恶魔女人的大作吗...？怪不得她表现得这么奇怪...
Haaa... Haaa... Huff... Huff...<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color> Aaan, someone, please. Hurry...! Hurry and come fuck me... Haaan, aah, aaaah...<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>=哈...哈...呼，呼...<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color> 啊嗯，找个谁来。快点操我...哈啊嗯，啊，啊...<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>
It's right above her womb. It's so strong... It's fixed on her because of the monster's magic... No... Has it gone out of control...?=就在她子宫的正上方。太强力了...因为怪物的魔力，其被固定在她身上...不要啊... 这已经失控了吗...？
There's no way to break a curse this powerful... She seems to just barely have consciousness thanks to her divine protection...but once her magic runs out...=如此强大的诅咒没有办法打破...多亏老天保佑，她似乎仅是没有意识了...但一旦她的魔力耗尽...
It was my duty to lead this girl down the path of salvation...but she's been raped and ruined by monsters...just like my friends back at the village...=我有责任带领这个女孩走上救赎之路...但她被怪物强奸和摧残...就像我村里的朋友们一样...
Do I have to...again...? I can't save her...=我必须...再一次那么做...？我救不了她...
Aah, please give this slutty knight more semen<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>=啊，请给我淫荡的骑士更多精液<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>

Tsk...=嘶...
Hmph. How vulgar... If you had told me about the curse before, I could have lifted it for you. But it's too late. You had this coming.=嗯。多么粗俗哇...如果你之前告诉我诅咒的事，我可以帮你解除的。但为时已晚。你早就料到了。
Aaah, hurry... You can use Ricca's slutty pussy and asshole all you want<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>=啊，快点...你可以用Ricca的淫荡的小穴、屁眼，做你想做的任何事儿<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>

Proceed to stage<line-height%3D125%>\r\nChapter 9 Writhing Sludge?=游玩关卡<line-height%3D125%>\r\n第 9 章  蠕动污泥？
Ominous Swamp=不祥沼泽

Urk... Nngh... Haa... Haa... Huff... Nngh... Ugh...=呜呜...嗯...哈...哈...呼嗯...呃...
(<indent%3D0.4em>My body... It sometimes starts to throb and yearn for pleasure because of the curse...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我的身体...因为诅咒，有时会悸动，渴望快乐...）
(<indent%3D0.4em>I occasionally touch myself a little...while Iris is asleep... But I'm God's servant, his holy knight... I shouldn't be so naughty... So corrupted... If Iris found out...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我偶尔抚摸一下自己...在Iris 睡着的时候...但我是阳神的仆人，圣骑士...我不该这么淫秽...如此堕落...如果Iris发现...）
Uugh... Nngh, aah... Huff, huff... Nngh... Haa...=嗯呃...啊，啊...呼，呼...嗯...哈...
Your curse is aching again, huh? Hold still for a sec; I'll re-apply the seal.=你的诅咒又开始痛了吧？等一下；我重新上封印。
Haa... Haa... Iris... Thank you...=哈...哈...Iris... 非常感谢。
It gets stronger when there are monsters nearby... It must react to evil magic. Ugh, you just had to get cursed, didn't you?=附近有怪物时，诅咒会变得更强...它肯定能与邪恶的魔力起反应。你只是被诅咒了，是吧？
Heh... I-I'm sorry...=呃...对，对不起...
Um... Iris...? Is there a Drain Crystal around here?=嗯...Iris...? 这附近有导能水晶吗？
There is... I can sense evil magic being released from the depths of this swamp.=有...我能感觉到邪恶的魔法正从沼泽深处释放出来。
We can reduce the number of monsters by destroying the Drain Crystal, right?=我们可以通过摧毁导能水晶来减少怪物的数量，对吗？
That's right. Drain Crystals absorb the magic from the earth and transfer it elsewhere while emitting waves of evil, attracting monsters and driving them wild.=对啦。导能水晶吸收大地的魔力，并将其转移到其他地方，释放出邪恶的浪潮，吸引怪物并驱使其发狂。
Once the Drain Crystal is destroyed, the number of monsters will decrease. You'll get a load of Magic Stones to strengthen your abilities with, too. Like killing two birds with one stone.=一旦导能水晶被摧毁，怪物的数量就会减少。你也会得到大量魔法石来增强你的能力。一石二鸟啊。
When you were defeated at the goblin fortress...I realized that you aren't strong enough to beat Archlich or even that demon woman yet...=你在哥布林要塞被击败时...我意识到你还没有强大到足以打败阿奎雷奇，甚至那个恶魔女人都打不赢...
The magic I felt from her was on a different level. It seems like she's able to disguise herself as a human, too. We can't just ignore her.=我从她身上感受到的魔力在另一个层面上。看起来她也能把自己伪装成人类。我们不能忽视她。
You want to get your sister back from the monsters, don't you? If you keep strengthening your holy knight abilities, even an idiot like you will have a chance to defeat them.=你想把你姐姐从怪物那里救回来，对吧？如果你继续强化你的圣骑士能力，即使像你这样的傻蛋也有机会打败他们。
...Idiot...=...傻蛋...
Oww... Alright. Let's keep looking for more Drain Crystals to destroy.=哦唔唔...行。咱继续寻找更多的导能水晶并破坏罢。

The Drain Crystal is some distance ahead... I guess we have to get through the swamp to reach it.=导能水晶在前面一段距离...我们得穿过沼泽才能到达。
It doesn't look that deep, but the mud will get caught on your legs and slow your movements. It'll make it harder to dodge enemy attacks, so try to walk on land when possible.=看起来没那么深，但泥巴会沾到腿上，减缓你的动作。更难躲避敌人的攻击，所以尽可能在陆地上行走罢。
Okay. Although, I'm sad that it'll ruin my outfit right after it was repaired... The swamp water's so muddy and filthy...=好喽。但是我挺伤心的，我才刚修好的衣服...沼泽的水又浑又脏...
Worrying about filth isn't going to get us any closer to the Crystal. Still, we don't know what could be lurking in the swamp, so be careful.=担心污秽不会帮我们瞬移到水晶那里的。诚然，我们仍不知道沼泽中隐藏着什么，所以要小心。
There's a hell plant here too...=这里也有地狱植物...
The evil magic of the Drain Crystal must have affected the vegetation around here.=导能水晶的邪恶魔力一定影响了这里的植被。
X Key / 1 Button=X键 / 1 按钮
The red and blue lotus leaves seem to move in response to your magic. It could be useful for us to move forward.=红色和蓝色的荷叶似乎在响应你的魔力。这对我们继续前进是有帮助的。
Upon grapple defeat by Mudrot Orc\r\n"Mud orc assimilation" \r\nH scene (Already seen)=被泥腐兽人击败后\n“泥兽人同化”\nH场景（已经看过）
Eeep! A big mud ghost...!=噫吁！大泥巴鬼呼...！
I think...that's an undead orc.=我想...那是一个不死兽人。
Orc? Those are the pig-faced monsters, right...?=兽人？那些猪脸怪物，对吧...？
Yes. They're green demi-humans like goblins, but they're much larger and greedier.=对。他们是像哥布林一样的绿色半人，但他们更大更贪婪。
Open=打开
I'm guessing it got stuck in the swamp and died, then the Drain Crystal's magic reanimated its corpse.=我猜它被困在沼泽里死去了，然后导能水晶的魔法让它的尸体复活了。
It looks like it can't move from that spot, but watch out.=貌似它不能从那个地方移动，但要小心。
That monster has acidic vomit made of gastric acid and spoiled food in its stomach. If it barfs on you, your armor and clothes are going to melt away.=那怪物胃里有由胃酸和变质食物组成的酸性呕吐物。如果吐在你身上，你的盔甲和衣服就会融化掉。
Melt away...!? Ugh, that's disgusting! I'm not letting that get on me!=融化掉...！？呃，真恶心！我毋令此玩意影响咱前行！
Some monsters are weak to elements like fire and ice. Hell beetles and monsters that live in water tend to be vulnerable to lightning.=有些怪物面对火和冰这样的元素很弱。地狱甲虫、生活在水中的怪物往往容易受到雷电的伤害。
By the way, your holy knight armor and gauntlet are weak to lightning, too.=顺便说一句，你的圣骑士盔甲、护手也招架不住雷电。
I see... So that's why my demon sister's lightning magic hurt so much...=晓得了...难怪我那恶魔姐姐的雷电魔法如此之痛...
Obtained Silver Magic Stone=获得银魔法石
Your armor's divine protection reduces damage, though, so it should save you from fatal wounds. What I'm worried about is you exaggerating the pain and getting caught while you're busy whining...=不过，你的盔甲的神圣保护可以减少伤害，所以你才未受致命伤。我担心的是你对痛苦大惊小怪，忙着抱怨的时候被抓住...
Are you sure about divine protection? Miria's purple lightning hurt so much, I couldn't move my body.=你确定有神的保护？Miria的紫色雷电太刺痛，挨一下动都动不了啊。
Don't talk like that - you're a holy knight! Gosh, you really need to learn to persevere... Your big sister Miria spoiled you rotten, didn't she?=别这么说嘛。你是个圣骑士！天哪，你真该学学坚持二字...你姐姐Miria把你宠坏了！
You don't have to say it like that... Ugh... That's not...true...=你不必那样说...呃...那不符...事实的...
Hell beetles... They're dangerous on land, but I especially don't want to deal with them around these swamps...=地狱甲虫...陆地上的它们很危险，但我尤其不想在沼泽地与它们打交道...
If you can't avoid their attacks in the mud, you can strike them right as they come at you.=你若无法回避它们在泥泞中的猛攻，可在其袭来时，直接胖揍它们。
Eww... My whole body's covered in mud...=哎呀...我全身都是泥...
My hands and feet are a mess, too... It feels so gross... Ugh... I smell like mud...=我的手脚也一团糟...太恶心了...呃...我沾上泥腥味了...
Heehee... But I just need to switch back to my normal form...=嘿嘿...但我只需要回到我的正常状态...
...and immediately transform again, and I'll be clean!=...马上再变身一次，我就干净了！
(<indent%3D0.4em>Yup... All clean and pure... If I keep repeating the transformation, the inside of my stomach should become clean... I can get rid of all the filth the goblins put in me...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>嗯哪...一切都干净纯洁...如果我不断重复这个变身，我的肚子内部应该会干净些...把哥布林搞在我身体的所有污垢都清除掉...）
Heehee... Heeheehee...! God gave me such wonderful powers! So convenient!=嘿嘿...嘿嘿...！老天给了我如此奇妙的力量！太方便了！
Hey, every time you transform into a holy knight, you consume magic. I know you want to be clean, but you've been transforming way too much lately. Can't you put up with a bit of dirt?=喂，每次你变成圣骑士，都会消耗魔力。我知道你想白白净净的，但你最近变身太多次了。你就不能忍受点儿灰尘吗？
Huh... H-Have I...? Alright...=呵...我有，有么...？好吧...
I can feel the magic from a Drain Crystal in that direction. Let's go.=我从那个方向感受到了导能水晶的魔力。走吧。
Okay... Ah, wait up, Iris...!=可以...等等，Iris...!
On the way through the swamp to break another Drain Crystal...=在穿过沼泽去消灭另一个导能水晶的路上...
(<indent%3D0.4em>*Sigh*)=(<indent%3D0.4em>*叹息*）
(<indent%3D0.4em>It's been about a week since we left the goblin fortress, but she's still in a bad mood... I guess it only makes sense. I'm always making her angry...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我们离开哥布林要塞已经一周了，但她仍然心情不好...皆因为我常气她吧...）
(<indent%3D0.4em>She only talks to me to reseal my curse, even when we're walking together... She hasn't found out about the goblins raping me...or what I do while she's asleep...has she?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>她和我说话只是为了重新封住我的诅咒，即使我们一起散步的时候也是...她还没发现哥布林强奸我的事...或者我在她睡觉的时候做的事...她不会发现吗？）
(<indent%3D0.4em>But... Ugh... This is so awkward... I don't want it to be like this forever... I wanna get along with her...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>但是...呃...这太尴尬了...我不想永远尬住...我想和她友好相处...）
U-Um... Iris...?=嗯，呃...Iris...?
What is it?=何事？
Umm, you're God's servant... I mean, God's messenger, right?=呃，你是阳神的仆人...啊啊，阳神的使者，对吧？
What about it?=咋地了？
What kind of person is God...? Oh, I guess he isn't a person, heehee... You've talked to him directly, right?=阳神是什么样的人...？哦，他不是人，嘿嘿...你直接跟他谈过，对吧？
Why do you want to know?=你为何欲知？
Huh...? Why...? Well... Um, I'm just surprised that God really exists...and I wanted to know more about you...=呵...？为何？呃...我只是很惊讶，阳神存在么...我想了解更多实例...
Hmph... Fine. I suppose you have the right to know. This is going to take a while to explain...=嗯...好吧。你有权知道。这需要点时间来解释...
My fellow fairies and I live in a forest in the mountains far northeast of here.=我和我的妖精朋友们住在遥远的东北偏僻山区的一片森林里。
Mountains far northeast... Aren't those mountains super tall...?=遥远的东北偏僻山区...那些山不是贼高吗...？
Yes, they are. My ancestors lived quietly in that forest surround by mountains. It was a peaceful land very few approached.=是哇。我的祖先安静地生活在群山环绕的森林里。其为很少有人接近的宁静之地。
Yet suddenly, ferocious monsters began to appear... Just like this area.=然而突然，凶猛的怪物开始出现...就像这地方。
So our ancestors climbed the mountain and prayed. Then God came down from the heavens before them...=所以我们的祖先爬上山祈祷。然后某阳神在他们面前从天而降...
...and drove away the monsters with a dazzling light, shining like the sun.=...用耀眼的光芒赶走了怪物，像太阳一样闪耀。
Well, that's the folklore that's been passed down in our village through the ages, but God really does periodically come to the forest to put up barriers and drive away foreign invaders with magic.=呃，这是我们村子里流传多年的民间传说，但阳神确实会定期来森林里设置屏障，用魔法赶走外来侵略者。
Huh... To be honest, it didn't really hit me even after I was chosen to be a holy knight, but... I guess God really does exist.=呵...说实话，即使在我被选为圣骑士后，我也没有真正惊讶到，但是...我估计此阳神真的存在。
Yes, but unlike what you humans believe, God isn't actually all-powerful...=是哇，但和你们人类所迷信的不同，神并不是万能的...
Our God is probably more like a high-ranking spirit or something close to a wraith... No, I shouldn't think like that - it's disrespectful...=我们的神可能更像是个高级精灵或是个接近幽灵的东西...嗨，我不应该这样表述，有点儿不尊重了哈...
In any case, God uses holy light magic to keep the balance between living creatures and protect us, just like the myth says.=在任何情况下，阳神使用圣光魔法保持生物之间的平衡并保护我们，像神话所说的一般。
God wants peace for this world and its inhabitants, and we fairies help our God by collecting information from various places, sometimes becoming God's hands and feet. That's how we return the favor for God protecting us.=阳神希望世界及其居民好好儿的，我们妖精从不同地方收集信息来帮助阳神，有时成为神的手足。此之谓回报阳神保护我们之法。
I see... So what kind of person... What kind of God is he?=晓得了...那么，它是什么样的人...阳神？
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I was one of the most outstanding among the young fairies of my village. I wasn't just made God's servant, I was given a name.=我不是故意吹嘘，但我是村里最杰出的小妖精啦。我不仅仅是阳神的仆人，我还被赋予了一个名字。
God always takes the form of a woman when she appears in our village. She looks dignified, but she's also very kind.=阳神总是以女性的形象现身于村。她很端庄，但也很善良。
Oh? So she was a Goddess... W-Wait, does that mean the holy sisters at church aren't God's wives, then...?=喔？她是女神啊...等等，这是否表示教堂里的神圣姐妹不是阳神的妻子，那么...？
She may often appear as female, but she's able to take many different forms, so I don't know if that's her true form.=她经常以女性的形象出现，但她能够采用许多形象，所以我不知道这是否是她的真形。
*Chuckle* She can be mischievous, too. One time, she surprised me by transforming herself to look like me...=*笑*，她也可能淘气啊。有一次，她把自己变成了我的样子，真的惊到我了...
Wow... Really...?=哇！真的嘛...？
One day, God told us that the world would soon be filled with evil power and that monsters would run rampant. She even told us that the seal the previous holy knight put on the Darkfiend Dragon is on the verge of being broken...=有一天，阳神告诉我们，世界很快就会充满邪恶的力量，怪物会猖獗暴乱。她甚至告诉我们，前一位圣骑士戴在黑暗之龙的封印即将被打破...
That's why she gave me the duty to look for the new savior - the one chosen to become a holy knight - and deliver the brooch to her, and accompany her in her quest to fight evil.=故而我有责任寻找新的救世主——被选为圣骑士的救世主——并将胸针交给她，陪伴她与邪恶作斗争。
I see... So that's why you came to me...=晓得了... 故而你来找我...
If I can accomplish my duty, God will continue to protect my village.=如果我能完成我的职责，阳神将继续保护我的村庄。
I want to protect my friends and family from wild animals, monsters...and humans...=我想保护我的朋友和家人，不受野生动物和怪物的伤害...也包括不受人类的伤害...
Protect them...from humans...? What does that... Oh... The fairies in the freak shows at the capital...=保护他们...不收人类的伤害...？什么意思...哦...王都怪物秀中的妖精们...
Tsk... It's not just that...=嘶...不仅仅是这事...
We fairies are small and weak...and not all fairies are good at magic like me.=我们妖精又小又弱...并不是所有的妖精都像我一样擅长魔法。
It's only natural for other species to target us for magic and food. It's survival of the fittest, after all...=其他物种为了魔力和果腹，自然把我们当作猎物。毕竟，适者生存...
I hate them for it...but I understand why humans capture fairies to make a show out of them... But I don't get why humans and demi-humans...=我因之恨他们...我清除为何人类要抓住妖精来表演...但我不明白为什么人类和半人类他们...
Why do they break our limbs, strip us of our wings, and stab us with tree branches? How can they treat us like toys...?=为什么他们会折断我们的四肢，剥去我们的翅膀，用树枝刺伤我们？他们怎么能像对待玩具一样对待我们...？
I don't get it... Do they enjoy doing that? What have we ever done to your kind!?=我不明白...他们喜欢这样做吗？我们对你们做过什么！？
I... I don't...=我...我不...
I know a fairy who had her stomach ripped by fingers from the inside... And another one who got ejaculated into so much she burst! Why can't they just simply kill us!? Why do they use us and then throw us away!?=我认识一个妖精，她的肚子被人用手指从里面撕开了...还有一个被射精得太厉害了，她胀破了！为什么他们不能直接杀了我们！？为什么他们玩弄、利用我们，然后才把我们扔掉！？
What... Ejaculated...? That's...just cruel...=什么...射精...？太...残忍了...
Cruel...? Of course it's cruel! All my brother did was go to his usual spot to pick some nuts...! To gather...what I asked him to get for me the day before...=残忍...？当然很残忍！我哥哥只是去他常去的地方摘些坚果...！收集...前一天我让他给我弄的东西...
...Iris... I didn't know...=...Iris... 我不知道...
Hmph... And you're on the side of those cruel humans...aren't you?=嗯...你站在那些残忍的人类一边...你不是吗？
I-I am not! *Sniff* I'm sure...only evil people do such cruel things... They're evil!=我，我不是！*抽泣*，我相信...只有邪恶的人才会做这样残忍的事...他们是犯下玩乐之罪恶了！
Evil? So are you saying all the humans that approach my village are evil?=罪恶？你是说所有接近我村子的人，都是不祥的？
Hick... I am... *Sniff*...ngh... The people of my village...would never do something so cruel...=嘤嘤...我...*抽泣*...嗯...我们村的人...永远不会做这么残忍的事...
Are you sure? The other fairies have told me that among those cruel humans they've seen children much younger than you.=你确定吗？其他妖精告诉我，他们见过比你小得多的孩子与之同列。
Ngh... No... I... No one... They don't want to be cruel... Those children...probably didn't know what they were doing...=嗯...不会哇...没有人...他们不会做残忍的事...那些孩子...可能不知道他们在做什么...
Hick... They aren't... Hick... ugh...hick... They're not all... Hick...=嘤嘤...他们不是...嘤嘤...呃...嘤嘤...他们不全是...嘤嘤...
*Sniff*... Oww... Hick... *Sniff*... I'm not... Hick... *Sniff*... *Sniff* Waaaaaah...=*抽泣*...哦呜呜...嘤嘤...*抽泣*...我不是...嘤嘤...*抽泣*...*抽泣，哇啊...
I know... I know you're not like those humans. You're a special human who was chosen to be a holy knight...=我知道...我知道你不像那些人。你是被选为圣骑士的特殊人类...
Hick... Oww... *Hick... Y-Yeah... *Sniff*...hick...=嘤嘤...哦唔...嘤嘤...嗯嗯...*抽泣*...嘤嘤...
It seems that a different village in the north does trade with humans, and God insisted that only some humans are evil... Not that I'm ready to believe that...=似乎北方的另一个村庄与人类有贸易往来，阳神坚持认为只有一些人是邪恶的...并不是说我愿意相信啊...
Ugh... Hick...=呃...嘤嘤...
Hmph... I'm sorry I yelled at you... Forget what I said...=嗯...对不起，我冲你吼了...忘了我说的吧...
Chapter 9    Writhing Sludge=第 9 章  蠕动污泥
For years, I've been training in the magical arts to get strong enough to avenge my comrades and get back at the humans who did terrible things to them... But you humans have short lives. If we leave you alone, you'll eventually die, anyway...=多年来，我一直接受魔法艺术方面的训练，以变得足够强大，为我的同伴报仇，并报复那些对他们做了可怕事情的人类...但你们人类的寿命很短。如果我们不理你们，你们终究会死的...
To tell you the truth, I don't care what happens to humans. They're unjust, filthy creatures. I don't understand why God lends her power to your kind...=说实话，我不在乎人类会发生什么。他们是不公正、肮脏的生物。我不明白为什么阳神会把她的力量借给你们...
Still, this is the decision of the God who protects my village. I'll fulfill the duty she assigned me no matter what.=不过，这是保护我村庄的阳神的决定。不管发生什么事，我都要履行她指派给我的职责。
Monsters are another matter, of course, and we fairies are too small and weak to fight. Your kind prays to God as well, so it makes sense that she chose a human to save the world. It doesn't sit right with me personally, though...=当然，怪物是另一回事，而我们精灵太小太弱，无法战斗。你们也向阳神祈祷，所以她选择了一个人类来拯救世界是有道理的。不过，我个人并不这么认为...
That's the reason I'm helping your kind.=所以我才要帮助你们。
I see...=晓得了...
I know that you're not the same as the humans who attacked my comrades... You must be a virtuous and pure person. Still, if you're going to fulfill your destiny as a holy knight, I need you to become stronger.=我知道你和袭击我同伴的人不一样...你肯定是一个善良、纯洁的人类。不过，如果你想完成你圣骑士的使命，我需要你变得更强大。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Pure...huh...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>纯洁...嗯呃...）
Judging by the way you speak, you must have grown up without struggle or hardship. You mentioned your parents are dead, so is it because of that female?=从你说话的方式来看，你一定是在没有困苦或艰辛的环境中长大的。你说你父母都死了，是不是因为那个女的？
Don't call her that... It's true that Miria took care of me, but I've had struggles in my life, too...=别这么叫她...没错，Miria照顾过我，但我的生活中也有困苦...
Like...?=比如...？
Well... Um... I had to walk on dangerous mountain paths and risk tripping, and tending the general store can get boring... And I'm poor, so I only get hand-me-down clothes, and Miria wouldn't make tomato soup like I asked her to...=呃...嗯...我不得不走在危险的山路上，冒着被绊倒的风险，照看杂货店可能会很无聊...我很穷，所以只穿旧衣服，Miria不会像我要求的那样做番茄汤...
Stop. I've heard enough. *Sigh* Looks like I have to be even stricter with you. Good grief, why did God have to pick you?=停下吧。我听够了。*唉*，看来我得对你更严格了。天哪，为什么阳神要选你？
You always run blindly ahead without listening to me. That's how you got stuck with that curse... You can't even appreciate the cooking I do for you...=你总是盲目地向前冲，不听我的话。这就是你被下诅咒的原因...你甚至不能感激我为你做的菜...
I get that you're not used to fighting, but I still see hesitation in your sword swings. And yet, when I try to help you practice, you immediately get tired...=我知道你不习惯战斗，但我仍然能看出你挥剑时的犹豫。还有啊，我试着帮你练习时，你马上就喊累...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Urk... I just wanted to get along with Iris, but I only made her mad at me... I shouldn't have talked to her...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呜呜...我只是想和 Iris 好好相处, 但我只是让她生我的气...我不该和她说话的...）
I've taught you how to purify crystals before, but you still can only make simple things, right?=我以前教过你如何净化水晶，但你仍然只能做简单的小活，对吗？
We can go over it again, so try to review what you learned yourself.=我们可以再复习一遍，试着复习一下学过的内容。
O-Okay...=好，好吧...

Grrrrwwwwooooh... Bweheehee, human woman...=咕咕唔唔唔哦哦哦哦...哔嘻嘻，人类女性...
Huff... My hands and legs... They're stuck in his mud body! I can't get out!=呼...我的手和腿...被困在他的泥巴里了！我出不去！
Why you...! *Blop*... *Bloop*...=为什么你...！*滴*...*滴*...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Iris...! She dived headfirst into the mud orc's body to save me...and now she's stuck! I have to save her soon or she'll suffocate...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>Iris...！她一头扎进泥兽人的身体里去救我...现在她被卡住了！我必须快救她，否则她会窒息而死的...！)

He's made of pure, deep-seated hatred and wicked magic energy. His power is incomparable to that of a wraith.=他是由纯粹的、根深蒂固的仇恨和邪恶的魔法能量组成的。他的力量是幽灵无法比拟的。

Okay, but...it's too dangerous to come here on your own. You'll get attacked by monsters, just like now.=好吧，但是...一个人来这里太危险了。你会被怪物攻击，就像现在一样。
No, I came here with two men I met on the main road, but...=不，我是和两个男人一起来的，是在大路上认识的，但是...
Before I knew it, they had left with all the money and goods they scavenged from the town... Still... *Sniff* I thought that I could find my three sisters here, somehow keeping each other alive...=在我发觉前，他们带着从镇上捡来的钱和货物离开了...尽管如此...*抽泣*，我以为我能在这里找到我的三个妹妹，彼此好好活着...

Ack... Aaah...=哎呀...啊啊...
Iris... Why!?=Iris... 为什么！？
I could have saved her... Why didn't you tell me that there was a person here sooner!? If only I had gotten to her quicker... I could have saved her!=我本可以救她...你为什么不早点告诉我这里有个人！？要是我能早些找到她就好了...我本来可以救她的！
I couldn't sense human life because the reaper's wavelength was overwhelming my senses. Don't take it out on me when it's your lack of strength that failed to save her.=我无法感知人类的生命，因为内死神的波长压倒了我的感官。不要拿我出气，因为你缺乏力量才救不了她的。
My lack of strength...!? What is that supposed to mean...!?=我缺乏力量...！？这是什么意思...！？
You're the holy knight here, aren't you?=你是这里的圣骑士，不是吗？
The more monsters you defeat and the faster you destroy Drain Crystals, the more casualties you can prevent, and the more lives you can save. It's as simple as that.=你打败的怪物越多，就能越快摧毁导能水晶，你能阻止的伤亡便越多，能拯救的生命便越多。就这么简单。
Come on, let's go look for more Drain Crystals. There's no use being in this town any longer.=走啦，我们去找更多导能水晶。待在这个镇上已经没有用了。

Mining Cave=矿山洞穴
I can feel a massive flow of magic energy from inside that cave... That demon woman's magic is coming from deep in there, too...=我可以感受到那个洞穴里面的巨大魔法能量流动...恶魔女人的魔法也来自深处...
Miria... Oww...Ugh... My tummy...=姐姐 ... 哦呜呜 ...呃...我的肚子...
I resealed the succubus' curse, but that woman's energy must be activating it... Stay still, and I'll strengthen the seal.=我重新封住了魅魔的诅咒，肯定那个女人的能量激活了它... 别动，我来加强封印。
Nnngh... I'm okay. I feel a little feverish, but I can handle it. I can still fight.=嗯嗯...我没事。我很好。我有点发烧，但我能应付。我还能战斗。
Oh, okay...?=好哦...？

Miria... How did you end up like that...?=姐姐... 你怎么会变成这样...？
Is that a cart for carrying stone? It's not too rusted... It might still move.=那是运石头的车吗？没有锈得太厉害...可能还能移动。
Hell beetles? Even in a cave like this?=地狱甲虫？甚至在这样的洞穴中也有？
Those bugs emit electricity. If you attack them while they're discharging, you're going to get electrocuted.=这些虫子会发电。如果你在它们放电的时候攻击它们，你会触电的。
Electricity... You mean lightning power? I might go numb if I touch them...=电...你的意思是雷电的力量？如果我触摸之，我可能会被电麻...
Exactly. If you do get electrocuted, you'll lose your ability to move for a moment.=确实。如果你真的触电了，你会暂时失去移动的能力。
It must be like the magic Miria used... Her lightning made my head flash and my whole body feel like it was on fire. It hurt so much...=这一定跟Miria用的魔法一样...她的闪电让我的脑袋一闪，我的整个身体就像着火了一样。太疼了...

Eeep, wh-what is this...? It's squirmy... It sort of looks like the sea anemone I saw in the encyclopedia...=呀呀，这，这是什么...？蠕动的 ...有点像我在百科全书里看到的海葵...
That's a roper. They use their long tentacles to capture approaching prey. You better get out of their grasp as fast as you can if you get caught by them. Otherwise, they'll eat you up.=那是一个套索触手。它们用长长的触手捕捉接近的猎物。如果你被抓住了，你最好尽快逃离其控制。否则，它们会吃掉你。
Ugh, looking at them for too long makes me sick...=呃，盯着它们看太久让我恶心...

That thing is huge... These mines must have been pretty busy before the monsters took over... Now it's a mere shadow of its former self.=那东西真大...在怪物占领之前，这矿山一定很繁忙...现在它只留下了过去的影子。
MP has been fully restored=MP已完全恢复

There! It's her!=那里！是她！
Oh my, you finally came... Heehee... So I see you haven't abandoned her yet, Miss Fairy...=天啊，你终于来了... 嘻嘻 ...看来你还没抛弃她，妖精小姐...
You must be very faithful to your God... And a good friends to Ricca, too...=你肯定非常忠诚于你的神...也是Ricca的一个好朋友...
Hold on. That woman probably has something up her sleeve, just like she did at the goblin fortress.=稍等。那个女人可能有一些诡计，就像她在哥布林要塞所做的那样。
Oh, Miss Fairy! You ruined the surprise! Now I can't use the thing I had planned... So sad...=喂，妖精小姐！你毁了惊喜！现在我不能用计划的内个了...我好伤心...
Heehee... Looks like your fairy friend doesn't like me very much... Whatever. Buzzing insects are of little concern to me...=嘻嘻 ...看起来你的妖精朋友不喜欢我...无所谓。嗡嗡作响的昆虫对我来说无关紧要...
You know, Ricca... I've very happy that you came to see me. I thought I would have to go pick you up myself. You're still a spoiled child, I see... *Giggle*=你知道的，Ricca...我很高兴你来看我。我还以为我得亲自去接你。你仍然是个被宠坏的孩子，我明白了... *笑*
Look at this ring... Isn't it cute? I made it out of the red gem from that necklace you gave me, since the original wirework was broken by the goblins.=看看这个戒指...不是很可爱吗？我用你给我的项链上的红色宝石做的，因为原来的金属线被哥布林弄坏了。

Heehee... Ricca, do you know what humans call this kind of gem?=嘻嘻 ...Ricca，你知道人类怎么讲评这种宝石吗？
This gem...is called a succubus crystal.=这个宝石...被称为魅魔水晶。
The pink hue symbolizes the color of a woman's privates. It's said that succubi love to wear this to tempt human men. Don't you think it's the perfect accessory for me? *Chuckle*=粉红色象征着女性私处的颜色。据说魅魔喜欢戴着这个来诱惑人类。你不觉得这是我的完美配饰吗？ *笑*
How vulgar. Sounds like something a human would come up with.=真粗俗。听起来像是人类能想到的东西。
How could...the store merchant...give that to me...?=商店老板...怎么可能...给我那个...？
Heehee... That's right. That gentleman was the one who gave this gem to you first, wasn't he? But he was killed by the goblins when they attacked our village...=嘻嘻 ...对喽。那个绅士是第一次给你这个宝石的人。但他在哥布林袭击我们村庄时被杀了...
I wish you could have seen how his eyes ran down my whole body every time he visited the dining hall. Actually, he started staring at you in the same crude way recently...=我真希望你能看到每次他来餐厅时，他的眼睛是怎样扫过我的全身的。事实上，他最近开始用同样粗鲁的方式盯着你...
I was worried that he was going to lay his hands on you one day... Heehee, but no need to worry about that anymore. I'm so glad the goblins killed him...=我担心有一天他会对你动手动脚... 嘻嘻，但不用再担心这个了。我很高兴哥布林杀了他...
Wha...! He would never do that... He was a little naughty sometimes...but he was always nice to me! He bickered with his wife a lot, but they stilled loved each other! He was a good person!=啥...！他永远不会那样做...他有些下流...但他总是对我很好！他和妻子总争吵，但他们爱着彼此！他是个好人！
Well... If you say so. But I thought he was no different from the other village men, or even the travelers passing by. They would all look at my body with an obscene gaze, wishing they could have me...=好吧...如果你这么说。但依我看，他与其他村里的男人没什么不同，甚至是路过的旅行者也一样。他们都会用淫秽的目光来看我的身体，希望他们能拥有我...
Same goes for the women. I tried not to stand out in the village by wearing drab clothes, but they still envied my looks... They hated me even after we lost our parents in the epidemic...=女性也是如此。我穿着土褐色的衣服，尽量不让自己在村里显得太显眼，但他们仍然羡慕我的长相...他们恨我，甚至在我们的父母死于流行病之后...
But when I look back at it now, I don't know why it bothered me so much. When I turned into a monster, I realized that all I ever wanted was to see you become happy with a nice family of your own...=但是，我现在回头看时，我不知道什么困扰着我。我变成一个怪物了，我才意识到我所想要的只是看到，你幸福地拥有一个属于你自己的家庭...
Oh, I won't allow a family with a human man, though! Heehee... Don't worry, I'll pick out a bunch of wonderful monster grooms suitable for my lovely sister!=但我不允许一个有人类的家庭！ 嘻嘻...别担心，我会为我可爱的妹妹挑选一群很棒的怪物新郎！
Damned female... How dare she even suggest that a holy knight sleep with a monster...=该死的女家伙...她怎么敢提出让一个圣骑士和怪物同寝......
You and I both have blue eyes and chestnut-colored hair tied into braids. We even have matching blue ribbons. The village people would always tell us how similar we looked...=你和我都有蓝色的眼睛，栗色的头发扎着辫子。我们甚至有相配的蓝丝带。村里的人总是讲我们长得多么像。
And the necklace with this red gem... The goblins saw me with it and liberated me from my ties to humanity. This was your gift to me... It made me so happy...=还有这条镶着红色宝石的项链...那只哥布林看到了我戴着它，把我从人类的束缚中解放出来。这是你给我的礼物...让我如此开心...
Shut up...!=住口...！
Shut up... Stop talking! You're not my sister!=闭嘴...别说了！你不是我的姐姐！
Why, Ricca...? Don't say that... You're making me so sad... Can't you see... I'm your sister, Miria.=为什么，Ricca...？不要那样说...你让我如此难过...你看不见吗...我是你的姐姐，Miria。
Could it be... You don't like my horns and wings? It's true that they sometimes get in the way when I walk through narrow spaces...but I think I look much cuter than before.=是不是...你不喜欢我的角和翅膀？确实，走过狭窄的空间时，它们会妨碍...但我想我看起来比以前更可爱。
Heehee... I'm sure the castle wizard will give you these too if we ask.=嘿嘿 ...我相信如果我们要求，城堡巫师也会给你这个的。
You're just jealous, right? You're acting like a spoiled child like always, trying to get my attention...=你只是嫉妒，对吗？你像一个被宠坏的孩子一样行事，试图引起我的注意...
I'm not...!=我不是...！
My sister... Miria would never take the side of monsters... She would never...hurt anyone...!=我的姐姐... Miria永远不会站在怪物那一边...她永远不会...伤害任何人...！
Ricca, that's not true... I'm a demon, a monster. It's only natural that I kill humans. I don't see what you're trying to say...=Ricca，非也...我是一个恶魔，一个怪物。我杀人类只是自然。我不晓得你想说什么...
Oh... But don't worry. You may be human, but you're an exception. I would never let anyone hurt my precious little sister. I swear.=哦...但别担心。你可能是人类，但你例外。我永远不会让任何人伤害我珍贵的小妹妹。我发誓。
That woman's been brainwashed... Or rather...her thoughts have completely turned into those of a monster.=那个女人被洗脑了...或者...更确切地说...她的想法完全转变为怪物的思考模式了。
I think you're the disgraceful one, Ricca. You shouldn't be running around in that knight costume wielding something so dangerous...=我觉得你才是不光彩的那个，Ricca。你不应该穿着骑士服到处乱跑，挥舞着这么危险的东西...
*Sigh* I knew you were always a bit of a tomboy, but this is ridiculous. Are you going through another rebellious phase?=*叹气* 我知道你一直是个假小子，但这太荒唐了。你正在经历另一个叛逆期吗?
I've heard enough! Shut up...you monster!=我已经听够了！闭嘴...你这怪物！
I'm going to cut those horns and wings off and get my real sister back!=我要把那些角和翅膀剪掉，让我真正的姐姐回来！
Where did you learn such rudeness, Ricca? *Sigh* I wanted to talk with you a little longer, but I guess you're not willing to...=你在哪里学的这么粗鲁的，Ricca？ *叹气* 我想和你谈谈，但我猜你不愿意...
I need to capture you for Master Archlich. Although, if I had my way, I would prefer to keep you by my side...=我需要为了阿奎雷奇主人抓住你。虽然，如果我有自己的方式，我宁愿让你靠近我...
This might hurt a little, but I'll make you feel muuuch better afterward, okay?=这可能会有点疼，但之后我会让你感觉舒服很多，好吗？

My body is chilled by the cold rain. It won't stop trembling from the disgusting, ticklish sensation from the orc.=我的身体因寒冷的雨水变冷。不停地颤抖，因为兽人带给我了那令人恶心、痒痒的感觉。
Aaah, nooo, aaah, ack, aaah... No, haaa...=啊，不，啊，哎呀，啊 ...不，哈啊 ...
I shiver and my spine tingles. I keep moaning sweetly from the stimulation.=我颤抖，我的脊柱刺痛。我在刺激中甜蜜地呻吟。
I know making such noises will only encourage the monster, but I can't hold them in.=我知道这种呻吟只会鼓励怪物，但我不能阻止。
Nnnngh, haaaaa... Eeek, nnhaaa... Uugh... Stop it already...!=嗯嗯嗯，哈啊啊啊... 哎呀，嗯哈啊... 呜呜...停下...！
Orcs... They're green demi-humans just like goblins, but they're much larger and stronger.=兽人...是绿色的半兽人，就像哥布林一样。但它们更大更强。
These monsters could easily snap my body in two if they were in a bad mood.=如果其心情不好，这些怪物可以很容易地将我的身体一分两半。
Bwehehe, you're lucky I'm a nice guy! I'll make you dripping wet!=卟嘻嘻，你很幸运，我是一个好家伙！我会让你湿润些！
The orc's tongue presses against the entrance of my vagina with a loud slurping sound.=兽人的舌头压在阴道入口时，发出响亮的水流声音。
It relentlessly tickles my clitoris and labia, causing my vagina to get wet.=它无情地舔弄我的阴蒂和阴唇，导致我的阴道湿了。
Bwehehe, if I don't get you wetter, I might tear right through your tight pussy!=卟嘻嘻，如果我不让你湿润些，我可能会撕裂你紧绷的阴部！！
He mocks me for clearly showing how turned on I am and twists his long fleshy tongue into me further.=他嘲笑我，清楚地看出我有多兴奋，并把他又长又肥的舌头进一步伸入我体内。
Eeeeeek, naaaaaaah! Eeek...! No, no, stooooop!=哎哎哎哟，呐唉唉唉唉！ 咿咿 ...！不，别，停啊啊啊！
The opening of my vagina makes squishing sounds as it's pressed open.=当我的阴道被打开时，发出了挤压的声音。
Oink...! *Slurrp, sluurp!*=哼哼...！ *拟音！*
The orc's hot tongue enters me and moves around in a large circle.=兽人的热舌进入了我的内部，移动出一个大圆的轨迹。
Hyaaa...!=嗨呀...！
The memories of the torture the goblins and succubus put me through, -all the ways they made me cum over and over - remained in my mind no matter how much time passed.=哥布林和魅魔折磨我的记忆，他们让我一次又一次高潮，无论过了多久，这些都留在我的脑海里。
My sister is dead and the Crest of Lust is gone, but every time Iris' seal weakens, I begin to go into heat, and my privates grow sensitive.=我姐姐已经去世了，欲望羽冠诅咒也消失了。但每次Iris的封印变弱时，我就开始发热，我的私处变得敏感。
Every time it happens, I rub my thighs and crotch against each other and press my nipples on the lining of my underwear to pleasure myself without Iris noticing.=每逢此时，我都把大腿和胯部互相摩擦，把乳头压在内衣的内衬上，在Iris没有察觉的情况下自娱自乐。
My body had long ago become lewd enough to appreciate the joy the orc's tongue provided.=我的身体很久以前就变得淫荡，足以适应兽人的舌头。
Aaaaaaaa, nnnheeek, it's so rough... Nngh, aaah... Stop, don't lick the inside of my vagina...=唉唉唉唉啊啊，嗯嗯咿咿，它好粗壮... 嗯嗯，啊啊 ...停止，不要舔我的阴道内部...
The orc's tongue moves around inside me. Its texture is much rougher than a human tongue.=兽人的舌头在我的里面移动。其纹理比人类舌头更粗糙。
My body takes in the hot sensation with delight. My nipples turn hard and tremble from the cold rain, and my clit becomes plump as it's teased by the orc's tongue.=我的身体愉快地变得火热，敏感。乳头在寒冷的雨中变得挺拔，颤抖，而我的阴蒂勃起，因为它被兽人的舌头戏弄。
I thought getting turned on from having the outside of my vagina licked was mortifying enough. Yet, when the tongue wiggles inside me, I let out even more humiliating moans.=我认为舔我的阴道外面让我兴奋已经够令人难堪的了。然而，当舌头在我内部摆动时，我发出更加羞涩的呻吟。
Aaaah, aah, aaah, hyaaaa...!=啊啊，啊，啊，嗨呀啊啊...！
I hate monsters. I hate them for doing terrible things to Miria, the village people, and all their other victims.=我讨厌怪物。我讨厌他们对Miria、村民和所有其他受害者做可怕的事情。
Still, I'm turned on from getting violated by a monster.=尽管如此，我仍然被怪物侵犯，逐渐感到兴奋。
This is mortifying...=这是羞耻的...
He seems more powerful than a goblin, but I may be able to defeat him without much trouble in my holy knight form. And yet, all I can do is tremble in fear.=他似乎比哥布林更强大，但我应该可以在我的圣骑士形式下击败他。然而，我能做的就是在颤抖中恐惧。
Aah...Ugh, uugh...=啊... 唔，唔...
The orc's tongue digs deeper and licks all over the inside of my vagina.=兽人的舌头在阴道内部深入探索，舔舐。
Hyaaaa... No, ack, aaaaaaaaah... Ah, aaaaaaaaa...!=嗨呀啊 ...不，呀呀，啊啊啊啊啊 ...啊，哎哎啊啊啊啊 ...！
Oink... Hmm? This taste...=哼 ...嗯呣？这种味道...
The movement of the tongue enjoying the texture of my vagina slows down.=舌头的运动享受我的阴道纹理的速度减慢了。
The orc seems to be trying to confirm what he is tasting is my shameful mucus.=兽人似乎试图确认他品尝的是我可耻的妹汁。
Nnhaaaa... Haaa... Haaa... Huh...?=嗯哈哈哈... 哈啊...哈哈...呵...？
Bwehehe! *Sluuurp* Sorry about that... Oink! It looks like my tongue ripped through you!=卟嘿嘿！ *咕噜* 抱歉... 哼哼！看起来我的舌头捅破你了！
R-Ripped...? Ripped what...?=捅破...？捅破了什么...？
For an instant, I fear that the violent movement of the tongue has torn my vagina's membrane.=有那么一瞬间，我担心舌头的剧烈运动撕裂了我的阴道膜。
But all I can feel from my crotch is gross warmth and sweet pleasure.=但我所能感受到的只是来自胯部的温暖和甜蜜的快感。
Bwehehe! I'll let you take a look too!=卟嘻嘻！我也会让你看看！
Eek... Don't...=咿咿...不要...
I hear a wet popping sound and tingle of pleasure when the orc pulls his tongue out of my vagina.=当兽人把他的舌头从我的阴道里拉出来时，我感知到一种潮湿的爆裂声和一种兴奋的感觉。
He finally moves his head away from my rain-soaked butt.=他终于把头从我被雨水浸湿的屁股上移开了。
He has no intention of freeing me, of course.=当然，他肯定不会放我走。
The orc tilts his body forward a little and brings his large face closer to me.=兽人把身体向前倾斜了一点，把他的大脸靠近了我。
And finally, he smirks at my face distorted in disgust and pleasure, and joyfully licks his lips.=最后，他对着我因厌恶和快乐而扭曲的脸傻笑，并愉快地舔着嘴唇。
Eeeeeek... Blood!?=咿咿噫...血！？
The tongue that comes out of his fanged mouth has a thick coat of red drool.=从它尖牙利齿的嘴里吐出的舌头有一层厚厚的红色口水。
I watch as the orc licks around his lips.=我看着兽人舔它的嘴唇。
Bwehehe! I ripped your hymen, duh! Look at all this blood! It's yours!=卟嘻嘻！我捅破了你的处女膜，堕！看看这血！是你的处女膜！

(<indent%3D0.4em>Aaah... No... That blood... It's from my...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>啊啊 ...不...那血...来自我的...）
I already know what losing your virginity feels like since I was deflowered by a large goblin.=我已经知道失去童贞的感觉，我被一个大哥布林夺走了。
My body is a little numb from the cold raindrops, but I don't feel any pain from the place the orc licked.=我的身体被冰冷的雨滴打得有些麻木，但兽人舔过的地方却没有任何痛感。
However, I can feel a different kind of ache even now.=但是，即使现在，我也能感受到不同的痛苦。
That heavy ache began when I first got to my sister's cave.=我第一次到达我姐姐的洞穴时，这种剧烈痛苦就开始了。
I have been feeling uncomfortable since morning today, and that discomfort only increased when I transformed out of my holy knight form.=自今天上午，我一直感到不舒服，并且当我解除圣骑士形态时，不适感增加了。
So that blood must be from...=所以这血液肯定是来自...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Why now...!? I'm about to get raped by a monster...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>为什么是现在...！？我即将被怪物强奸...！）
I thought something had happened to my body when I was raped by the goblins and succubus.=当我被哥布林和魅魔强奸时，我以为我的身体发生了一些事情。
But when the orc showed me his blood-covered tongue, I realized that my body is functioning properly.=但是当兽人向我展示了他的含血的舌头时，我意识到我的身体还在正常运作。
Bwehehe, I gotta prepare you so you'll have my kids...=卟嘻嘻，我得准备准备，确保你会怀上我的孩子...
A few weeks before I met Iris, I read a book that included information on orcs.=在遇到Iris之前几周，我读了一本包括关于兽人信息的书。
The encyclopedia had terrifying things written in it, like how orc semen is able to cling inside a woman and live for a whole month.=百科全书里面写了令人害怕的事情，就像兽人精液如何能够附着在一个女人体内并存活整整一个月的。
The information might have been exaggerated to fuel fear in the reader, but now that I have a real, muscular orc with blood-shot eyes in front of me, I fully believe it.=这些信息可能被夸大了，令读者恐惧，但现在有一个真实的，强壮的兽人在我面前瞪着血红的眼睛，我现在完全相信了。
If this orc rapes me now, I am sure to become pregnant.=如果这个兽人现在强奸我，我一定会怀孕。

The bloody tongue enters my vagina once again with a slurp.=血腥的舌头咕嘟一声再次进入我的阴道。
Ugh... Eeeeeeeeeeek...!=呃... 咿咿噫...！
Inside my vagina, the orc's fat tongue stirs his saliva and my drool, blood, and juices together.=在我的阴道内，兽人的肥胖的舌头搅拌他的唾液和我的口水，血液和粘液。
The blood overflowing inside me must be thick and full of clumps.=我体内溢出的血液一定很浓，而且聚成血块。
I grow pale as I imagine the clots of blood being churned up inside my privates.=当我想象血块在我的私处搅动时，我的脸色变得苍白
Bwehehe, I'm gonna drink your blood! It's sure to get me pumped!=卟嘻嘻，我要喝你的血！这肯定会让我兴奋不已！
Aaaaah... No, stop...!=啊啊...不，停下来...！
The orc's large mouth covers my crotch and begins sucking and licking at the scum in my vagina.=兽人的大嘴覆盖了我的裤裆，开始在我的阴道中的浮渣中吮吸，舔舐。
Eeek... Don't... That blood isn't... Uurk... Stop...=咿咿...不要...那血不是...呜呜...停下来...
How horrible. Absolutely disgusting. Anyone who enjoys that stuff must be out of their mind.=多么可怕。绝对令人作呕。喜欢这种东西的人一定是疯了。
I'm scared. This is embarrassing. It's so nasty...!=我很害怕。尴尬。太讨厌了...！
*Shlrrrup!*=*咕噜！*
Aah... Eek...!=啊... 咿咿...！
Bwehehe, look how much is coming out!=卟嘻嘻，看看有多少出来了！！
The orc pulls its tongue out and shows me the sticky thick blood covering his tongue and lips again.=兽人将舌头拉出来，向我展示粘稠的血液覆盖着的舌头和嘴唇。
The familiar red mucus stuck on it confirms my suspicion. I know what that blood is.=粘在上面的熟悉的红色粘液证实了我的怀疑。我知道那是什么血。
Oink! Your blood's thick and tasty! Bwehehehe... You wanna taste!?=哼！你的血液粘稠而美味！ 卟嘻嘻...你想尝尝吗！？

Bweheheh! Oink, oink!=卟嘻嘻！哼，哼！
It's painful, sad, and frustrating. I can't stop my tears from overflowing.=痛苦，悲伤，沮丧。我无法抑制我的眼泪溢出。
Still, that doesn't mean I'm used to the forced kisses of filthy monsters.=尽管如此，并不意味着我习惯于被强迫与肮脏的怪物亲吻。
Just like my privates, my mouth has already been sullied many times by goblins.=就像我的私处一样，我的嘴已经被哥布林多次玷污了。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Aaah... The orc's mouth...is on my lips...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>啊啊...兽人的嘴巴...在我的嘴唇...）
His fanged, drooling mouth pushes against my mouth and aggressively sucks onto my lips.=他的尖牙，流口水的嘴推入我的嘴，并积极吮吸我的嘴唇。
After the gritty tongue licks around my mouth, it tries to push its way into my closed lips.=在坚韧的舌头舔过我的嘴后，它试图挤进我紧闭的嘴唇。
The orc puts his weight on my head so I can't escape. The tongue itself is a large muscle, so it breaks through my lips quite easily, despite how hard I tried to keep them closed.=兽人把他的体重压在我的头上，故而我无法逃脱。舌头本身是一块很大的肌肉，很容易突破我的嘴唇防线，尽管我很努力地想闭上它们。
Ffffmmmgh! Nnnnnghhhh... Shluuurp!=呋呋呣呣呃！ 嗯嗯呵呵呵... 咕噜！
My mouth is filled by the orc's long, fat tongue.=我的嘴巴被兽人的长厚脂肪舌头填满了。

The texture of soft, chunky blood.=柔软厚实的血液质地。
When I think about how I'm being forced to lick the fallen lining of my womb, I'm repulsed to my core.=当我想到我是如何被强迫舔我子宫的下腔时，我的内心深处充满了厌恶。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Urk... This is...what my period...tastes like...? Stop, I don't want to... I don't want to eat this...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呜...这是...我的月经的...味道...？停下，我不想...我不想吃这个...！）
Oink!=哼哼!
The orc's moist nasal breath sprays my nose.=兽人潮湿的鼻腔呼吸喷到了我的鼻子上。
Ngh, mnnnnnnnhhh!=嗯，呣嗯嗯嗯嗯！
Because the back of my mouth is plugged with mucus, I accidentally breathe his nose breath in.=因为我的口腔后部被粘液堵住了，我不小心把他的鼻息吸入了。
Haaa... Haa... Haaa... Hick... Ugh... *Sniff*=哈啊... 哈... 哈啊... 嘤嘤... 唔... *抽泣*
I am forced to swallow a mass of smelly, disgusting drool and my own menstrual blood.=我被迫吞下一团又臭又恶心的口水和我自己的月经血。

Now then... Bweh heh heh... Now that you're wet with blood, I don't have to tease you anymore, right?=那么那么... 卜 卜 嘻 嘻 ...现在你被血液弄湿了，我也不必再挑逗你了，对吧？
The orc's hand on my butt releases its grip.=兽人放在我屁股上的手松开了。
The orc then stands up and removes the waistband covering his hardened manhood.=然后兽人站起来，脱下覆盖着他坚硬的成年男性标志的腰带。
Bwehehe, you better thank me, you smelly piss brat! I'm gonna rip what's left of your hymen to shreds and tear your pussy to fit my cock!=卟呵呵，你最好谢谢我，你这个顽童！我要把你的处女膜撕成碎片，把你的阴部撕成碎片来装我的老二！
The penis that towers over me from his crotch has the thickness of an arm.=他的裤裆耸立在我身上的阴茎有手臂那么粗。
It's covered in warts, and even in the heavy rain, I can see the thick precum leaking out of the tip.=它长满了疣，即使在大雨中，我也能看到厚厚的前列腺液从尖端漏出..

If that thing is inserted into my cold, weak body against the wet ground, my spirit and body will definitely break.=如果那东西对着湿漉漉的地面插进我冰冷虚弱的身体，我的精神和肉体肯定会崩溃。
But without my holy knight form, it's impossible for me to run away from this monster.=但没有我的圣骑士武装，我不可能从这个怪物手里逃脱。
I know that after I get raped here, he's going to take me to his den and use me as a tool for producing children until I die.=我知道，在我被强奸后，他会把我带到他的巢穴，并把我作为生孩子的工具，直到我死去。
After I give birth to dozens of children, I'm going to break, and then he's going to kill me.=在我生下几十个孩子之后，我会崩坏，然后他会杀了我。

When the knight reached the top of the castle, the evil wizard appeared along with an ominous light. The wizard spoke...=当骑士到达城堡顶部时，在那里，邪恶的魔法师出现了，伴随着不祥的光芒。他说...
"Servant of God! Holy Knight! You must be a fool to come challenging me! I will defeat you and take over your body!"=“神的使徒！圣之骑士！你欲克余，愚不可及！余将反而击败你，接管你那具身躯！”
But the knight was unfazed by the evil wizard's words. Before he finished talking, the knight cut the wizard in half with his sword!=骑士大人并没有被邪恶魔法师的话吓到。魔法师还没说完，骑士就用剑把他劈成了两半！

(<indent%3D0.4em>I stayed up late last night reading this "Strange Creatures Encyclopedia" I borrowed from the general store. I thought it would have cute critters in it, but it was mostly monsters. Still, it was so interesting I couldn't put it down...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我昨晚熬夜看了这本从杂货店借的《奇异生物百科全书》。我本以为里面会有可爱的小动物，但大部分都是怪物。但是，真很有趣，我爱不释手...）
Ricca, hurry up and come over here.=Ricca, 快点过来。
Okay! I gotta change first, so hold on a sec.=好！我得先换衣服，再等一下，姐姐。

You're going to the mountains in the afternoon, right?=你下午要去山上，是不是？
Yup. The merchant asked me to get him some herbs.=是嘞。老板让我给他采些草药。
I see... In that case, I'll ask you to get some for me, too. I was thinking of serving them with the meals at the dining hall.=好吧...那样的话，我也请你帮采一些。我想在餐厅里为他们做做菜。
Alright. How much do you need?=好吧。你要多少？
I just want to try it out for now, so...can I ask you to get a little bit of a few different kinds of herbs?=我想整点新活...能请你采集一些没试过的的草药吗？
Sure. I'll try to get as many kinds as I can.=当然。我尽量多搞一些。
Great, thank you, Ricca. Oh, but...=太好了，谢谢你Ricca。但是...
Don't go too deep into the mountains, okay? I've heard that monsters are getting restless around here lately...=不要深入山里，好吗？听说最近这里的怪物越来越不安...
...Miria, this again?=...姐, 又来这套？
I'm just worried, Ricca. I was talking with a customer, and he said that the town you and I went to some time ago got taken over by monsters. I heard the forest settlement at the foot of this mountain got attacked by goblins, too.=我只是担心你啊Ricca。我之前和一位顾客谈话，他说咱俩前段时间去的那个城镇被怪物占领了。山脚下的森林定居点也遭到了哥布林的袭击。
Wasn't that town really far away, though? And we only went there when we were young. The forest settlement didn't suffer much, either. You're worrying too much.=不过，那个小镇不是离这很远吗？我们小时候才去。森林定居点也没有受到太大影响。\n你太担心了。
Besides, we have Donny patrolling the outskirts of this village, and the only monsters we see on the mountain road are the occasional slime. It's the same as it ever was.=此外，我们有Donny在村庄的郊区巡逻，在山路上偶尔出现的唯一怪物不过是史莱姆。\n和以前一样。
But...=但是...
It's okay, I'm not a kid anymore. You worry too much!=没关系，我不再是孩子了。你太担心了！
...I do not. Besides, you still act like a child...=...我才没有。你其实表现得还像个小毛孩子...
Remember that time we played hide-and-seek and you didn't come back home?=还记得玩捉迷藏的时候，你没回家那件事儿吗？
I thought something had happened to you and got so worried...=我还以为你出了什么事...
I searched for you in and out of the village, but then you just popped out of the church!=我在村子里到处找你，最后你却从教堂底下偷摸溜了出来！
I told you that God would be offended if you fooled around in his holy place, but you forgot about my warning...=我讲过，如果在阳神的圣所鬼混，阳神会不悦的，你全然忘了...
We rarely get earthquakes around here, but after that incident, the ground shook and some parts of the underground tomb collapsed, you know? I bet it was God showing us how mad he was at you.=我们这里很少有地震，但那事之后，地面震动，地下墓穴部分坍塌。阳神貌似在向你泄愤。
Urk... That was a long time ago, and I already apologized for that. How many times are you going to bring that up? It's getting annoying.=唔... 那是很久以前的事了，我已经道过歉了。你要搬出来多少次？真的烦人。
Oh, do I really talk about it that often? Speaking of which, where were you hiding all that time? I thought I searched the church inside and out... Or were you...=我经常翻旧帐么？话说回来，你一直躲在哪里？我把教堂里里外外都找遍了...你...
Phew, thanks for the food, Miria. Time to do the dishes...=呜呼，谢谢你的食物，姐姐。我该洗碗了...
...I'll take care of them. You go on ahead, but make sure you get back home early.=...我整吧，你先出发，但一定要早点回家。
What do you want for dinner tonight?=你今晚想吃什么？
Anything that doesn't have raw tomatoes in it.=任何不含生番茄的食物。
Alright... But that's what I mean when I say you're still like a child. You won't make a good wife if you don't stop being a picky eater!=好吧...我就是说你还不成熟。如果你不改掉挑食的赖毛病，你怎么能成为好妻子！
A good wife...? Whatever... Alright, I'm off, Miria!=好妻子...？无所谓啦，我走啦，姐姐！
See you later... Careful not to trip on the mountain path! And if you see any monsters, come back home right away!=再见...小心别在山路上绊倒！你看到怪物就马上回家！
Heehee, I know, I know!=嘿嘿，我知道，我知道！
===========切换无声============
The sun feels amazing! Today's weather is perfect!=阳坡超级棒！天气巨好！
No one can blame me for sleeping in past noon on a day like this, right? Heehee!=这样的好天，没人能怪我睡了这么久吧？嘿嘿！
Anyway, what's with Miria? She seemed really worried...=呃，姐姐怎么了？她似乎真的很担心...
Well, I guess she's always like that.=额... 她一直都这样。
I'm glad she's always looking after me and all, but I wish Miria would find herself a husband soon.=我很感激她一直在照顾我和大家，但我希望姐姐她早日找个丈夫。
She keeps asking me if there are any boys I like and telling me that a girl's true happiness is in having a family, but she should be telling herself that.=她一直问我有没有喜欢的男孩，还告诉我女孩真正的幸福在于成家...她应该多想想自己。
Maybe she hasn't gotten married so she can keep taking care of me...=也许她还未嫁人，是为了可以继续照顾我...
No, I don't think so. I know she said she wanted to get married too... And I'm not a kid anymore, either. She doesn't have to baby me.=不，不会的。她说她也想结婚... 我也不再是孩子了。她不必照顾我啊。
Oh, hello there, Ricca.=你好，Ricca。
Hello, ma'am.=你好，太太。
Are you out to pick wild plants again?=你又要去采摘野生植物了吗？
Yup! Your husband and my sister asked me to gather some herbs.=是的！你丈夫和我姐姐让我采些草药。
Oh, I think he mentioned something about that. Anyway, be careful. It looks like there's been more monster activity lately...=哦，他提到过。无论如何要小心。最近有更多的怪物活动...
Heehee, Miria told me the same thing. She's such a worrywart...=嘿嘿，姐姐也这么说。她真是个忧心忡忡的人...
That's because you're very important to her. *Chuckle* You are her precious little sister, so of course she's going to worry.=那是因为你对她很重要吧，*笑* 你是她的宝贝妹妹，她当然会担心。
Heehee... Thanks! But, to be honest, I think she should stop looking after me so much. She could easily find a husband for herself if she tried...=嘿嘿...谢谢！但是，说实话，我觉得她不应该过分照顾我。她找到个丈夫还不容易？只要她试一试的话...
I agree, Miria is a beautiful lady, just like you.=对对，Miria是美丽的女子，就像你一样。
She gets so many opportunities to talk to travelers at the dining hall. If she just wore flashier clothing instead of the plain dress she always wears, she could get all the men she wanted...=她在餐厅，有很多机会与旅行者交谈。如果她穿更华丽的衣裳，而不是一直穿的朴素布衣，哪个男人不动心啊...
Flashier clothes...?=更华丽的衣裳...？
Yes, yes... If I were pretty like Miria...=对，对... 我要是长得像Miria一样漂亮...
I would wear a blouse that showed my cleavage, and a frilly short skirt that exposed my thighs and just barely hid my panties...=我敢穿露出乳沟的衬衫，露出大腿的褶边短裙，几乎只遮住内裤...
And then every time I served a customer, I would use a sweet flirty voice. I bet I could've gotten a richer husband if I was her. <size%3D75%>Agh... Curse my rotten luck...</size>=然后每次我为顾客服务时，都用甜甜的调情音。必能钓个更富有的丈夫。 \n<size%3D75%>哎...我这辈子的坏运气啊...</size>
Umm...ma'am!? What's wrong!?=嗯...太太！？怎么了！？
Oh? It's nothing. I'm just saying, I think Miria could find a nice man if she dressed in sexier clothes. Heeheehee.=哦没什么。我只是说，我想Miria如果穿着更性感的衣服，就能找到好男人。嘿嘿。
Sexier, huh... Ahaha... I-I guess so. I think she would look better in cuter clothes too, but she always dresses really drab...=更性感，嗯...啊哈... 我，我想也是。她穿更可爱的衣服也会好看，但她总是穿着单调...
Absolutely. She didn't always dress so plainly, you know. When Miria first moved to this village with your parents, she was fashionable just like girls her age ought to be.=肯定的。她之前可不这样。Miria和你父母刚搬到这个村子时，她和同龄的女孩穿得一样美。
Oh, really? I've only seen her dress like how she does now...=真的吗？我只见过她现在的样子...
No wonder, this was around the time you were born.=难怪，那会儿你才刚出生呢。
By the way, I heard from my husband that Miria's been looking a bit down these days. Is she alright?=对了，我丈夫告诉我Miria这几天有点沮丧。她还好吗？
Oh, he said that? I didn't notice anything strange about her...=他说了这话？我没注意到她有什么奇怪的地方啊...
Oh, is that so? My husband must have misunderstood something then. Sorry to worry you.=是这样吗？我丈夫一定是误解了什么。抱歉让你担心了哈。
*Chuckle* Well, I'll let you get back to your errand. Don't make your sister worry too much, alright?=*笑* 好了，你继续你的差事吧。别让你姐姐太担心嗷。
Yes, ma'am!=好嘞，太太！
Oh, it's Polon.=哦，是小狗Polon.
Heehee! Woof, woof!=嘿嘿！汪，汪！
Woof, woof! *Whine*=汪，汪！
I'm gonna go to the mountains! Heehee! Woof!=我要去山上！嘿嘿！汪！
Woof!=汪！
Hey, it's Ricca. Hi there. You sure do get along with Polon.=是Ricca啊，你好。你和Polon相处良好啊。
Hi, Donny.=你好，Donny。
You're going to the mountains again? Be careful of the monsters. They've gotten a lot more active lately...=你又要去山上了？小心怪物。他们最近更活跃了...
Ahaha... Not you too. The lady from the general store and my sister told me the same thing.=啊哈... 你也说。杂货店太太和我姐姐也告诉了我同样的事。
I bet. Miria can get pretty wound up worrying for you, but I don't think I can blame her. You can get a bit high-spirited sometimes.=Miria会担心你吧，但我不责怪她。你有时会兴奋过头办傻事。
But she's right. It's been about three years since I was deployed to this village, but the monsters have gradually increased in number, and they're getting a little more violent.=但她做的对。我被派到这个村子已经三年了，但是怪物逐渐数量增加，而且更加暴力。
Really? All I see are the occasional slimes squirming around, so I didn't think anything had changed.=真的？我只看到偶尔蠕动的史莱姆，我觉得什么都没变啊。
It's something I learned from regularly making rounds and writing records. You shouldn't underestimate slimes, either.=我从常年的巡视和记录中学到：不应该低估史莱姆。
Slimes may be slower compared to other animals, but they sneak up to their prey in search of bodily fluids. Back when I was at the capital, I heard stories about elderly folks and children falling victim to them.=与其他动物相比，可能史莱姆的速度较慢，但它们会偷偷靠近猎物以寻找体液。我在王都的时候，我听过老人和儿童受害的故事。
Small children? Oh, that's awful... Actually, I think I remember getting chased by one when I was small, too. It stings if you touch their bodies...=儿童？太糟糕了...其实吧，我还记得我小的时候被史莱姆追过。触碰它们就会感到刺痛...
If enough slimes surround you, even an adult can become paralyzed and get eaten by them. So you better be careful, Ricca. I don't want to see Miria cry because something happened to you.=如果大量的史莱姆在周围，即使是成年人也会瘫痪，被吃掉。所以你最好小心点，Ricca。\n我不想看到Miria因为你出了事而哭泣。
Heehee... Don't worry, I'll be careful.=嘿嘿...别担心，我会小心的。
Okay, I'll see you later!=好的，回头见！
See you! Be careful not to trip! And come right back if you see a monster, alright?=再见！小心别绊倒了！你看到怪物马上回来嗷！
Ahaha, alright!=啊哈哈，好！

Let's see, I'm pretty sure the hill in this direction has a bunch of different herbs...=我觉得山的这侧有些许奇珍草药...

Slimes...? There weren't this many when I was last here..=史莱姆...？我上次来的时候才没有这么多呢...
Ugh, they're so slimy... I can't stand these things. Welp, I guess I'm not getting any herbs today.=呃，它们太粘了...真受不了啊。嗯，看来今天没法采集草药了。
Mister merchant is going to be disappointed in me...=老板会对我失望的...
And so is Miria... She's going to get really scared if I tell her that I saw a monster, too...=姐姐也是...如果我告诉她我也看到了怪物，她会吓坏的...
She might even tell me never to go into the mountains again.=她甚至会叫我再也别上山了。
They're kinda gross...but I should be able to handle slimes by myself, right?=有点恶心...但我自己应该能处理史莱姆，应该吧？
I remember watching mister merchant drive them away by hitting them with a stick, too...=我也曾见老板用棒子打走它们...
They move pretty slow, so I could just run away if it gets dangerous, and I should get rid of them before they attack anyone else. I don't want Miria treating me like a kid forever, either.=其动作迟缓，如果有危险，我可以溜走啊。而且在怪物攻击民众前赶它们走，也是积德了。何况我也不想姐姐永远把我当孩子看待。
Let's see... Oh! Heheh, a branch like this should work.=...哦！呵，此灌木枝条，品相就不赖嘛。
======有声=动作===
I feel bad for hitting these slimes with a stick... As long as I don't get close to them, all they do is squirm.=史莱姆，用棒子打它，好可怜呐 ...若我不靠近，它们就只会蠕动罢了。
But there are so many of them... No, if I don't get rid of them now, they're going to attack the village's livestock and children.=嗯嗯，这么多到了村里...，说不定会攻击动物和孩子们的。必须现在除掉。
Wh-What's with that pillar of light? It came out of nowhere... I think it's made of magic...=突然出现的光柱的玩意？从哪里冒出来的...像是魔法之光...
It's so shiny and pretty...=又闪又亮，真漂亮...
Whoa...! There's letters in the sky!=哇...！天上有浮空的文字！
Is this...a magic sign? Is this a trick someone set up?=这是...魔力告示？这种地方，谁做的？
Hmm, what does it say...? These characters are kinda hard to read, but I think it says..."How to defeat monsters."=嗯，上面写的什么...？这些飞字有点难读，但上面写了...“怪物的击败方法。”
I-I got them!=我...我击败它了！
Heehee! I'm actually stronger than I thought! Alright, let's get rid of the rest of them!=嘿嘿！我其实挺强！好嘞，把剩下的都退治掉吧！
Upon defeat by Slime\r\n"??????????" \r\nH scene=被史莱姆打败后\r\n“??????????" \r\nH场景
Upon defeat by Slime\r\n"Licked by a slime" \r\nH scene (Already seen)=被史莱姆打败后\n“被史莱姆舔”\nH场景（已经看过）
Oh, this shiny red stone... It's a Magic Stone. Sometimes monsters drop them, or you can find them floating in the air.=哦嚯，闪亮的红色石头...魔法石。怪物会掉落，也可以在空中收集。
They're a magic tool. If I take them to the general store I help out at, I can exchange them for money.=有魔力的小玩意。把它们带到我帮忙的杂货店，可换钱呢。
Even if I had a basket full of them, I'd only have enough money to buy a snack, though...=即使有满满一篮子，也只够买点儿小零食...
<b>HP Gauge</b>\r\n The red gauge in the top left corner will decrease when you take damage from an enemy.\r\n Ricca will be defeated upon losing all HP.\r\n In addition, if you're defeated when the [Upon defeat ~ H scene]\r\n prompt in the bottom left is visible, then...\r\n Try your best to avoid being defeated by monsters.=<b>HP条</b>\r\n 当你受到敌人的伤害时，左上角的红色仪表将降低。\nRicca 在失去所有HP后即被击败。\n此外，如果你在左下角的提示\n[失败时~H场景]时失败，那么...\n请尽量避免被怪物打败。
I know. I'll collect a bunch of stones and spend the money to buy some sweets for Miria.=正巧。我收集魔法石，然后花些钱给Miria买些糖。
Hehe, I think she'll forgive me for coming home late if I give her a bunch of sweets.=呵呵，我给她糖，就算回家晚了，她也会原谅我的啦。
<b>Magic Stone</b>\r\n Enemies will drop red stones of condensed magic when they're slain.\r\n They'll come in handy later so be sure to collect them.\r\n There is one hidden Silver Magic Stone per stage\r\n and it's worth about 50 Magic Stones.=<b>魔法石</b>\r\n 敌人被杀时会掉落浓缩魔法的红色石头。\n它们以后会派上用场的，所以一定要把它们收起来。\n每个关卡有一个隐藏的银色魔法石\n价值约50块魔法石。

Okay, this should be enough for both of them.=好，绝对管够喽。
Oh... Is that the church bell I hear? Then it must be evening already.=教堂已鸣钟磬之音，晚夜将至。
Once I'm back at the village, I need to drop these herbs off at the general store.=我回到村子，还得把这些草药送到杂货店。
I got a bunch of Magic Stones too. I wonder what I should get for Miria.=我拾取了一堆魔法石。不知该给姐姐买什么。
Hello, mister... Or should I say, "good evening?"=老板...额，晚上好？
General Store Owner=杂货店老板
Oh, hey Ricca. Hiya.=Ricca你好啊。
Here are the herbs you asked for.=这是你要的药草。
Great, thank you always! How were the mountains? Did you see any monsters? I heard they're pretty restless lately...=谢谢你总是这么给力！山里情况如何？ 你看到怪物了没有？ 听说它们最近很不安分...
Hahahah... Here we go again...=哈哈哈...人们又说这话喽...

Heehee, no need to worry. I was strong enough to beat them myself. See? Hyah! Hyah! Take that!=嘿嘿，不用担心。我很强的，可以自己做事！看好了嗷，嗨！嗨！
That's impressive... But you still ought to be careful. If something happened to you, Miss Miria is going to get mad at me for sending you off on the errand in the first place.=真行啊你...但你还是要小心。如果你出了什么事，Miria小姐会生气的。都是因为我一开始就派你去出差。

I collected some Magic Stones while I was out picking the herbs. I wanted to buy something for Miria.=我在外面采药的时候收集了些魔法石。我想给姐姐买点东西。

(<indent%3D0.4em>A mage girl...? I wonder if she made the magic sign I saw on the mountain path, too...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>法师女孩...？她是不是做了在山路上看到的魔法符号...）

Eek! Mister! Don't hit my butt!=哎呀！老板！别打我屁股！
Ghahaha! You're growing into a busty lady too! Say hello to Miria for me!=哈哈哈！你也长成了丰满的女子哇！代我向Miria问好呗！
Oh, mister... Alright, see you tomorrow!=哦，老板...好吧，明天见！
Oh, Ricca, you're back from the mountains.=Ricca，你从山上回来了啊。
Oh, hello, ma'am. Excuse me, I need to get going.=嗯。太太你好。但对不起，我得走了。

Hey, what happened to the necklace that was here?=欸，项链哪去啦？
Oh, the one with the gem? I, um, gave it to Ricca...=哦，有宝石的那个？ 我，嗯，我把它给Ricca了...

Alright, I'll forgive you for giving it to Ricca. I appreciate her for always helping out at the store, but...=好吧，我又不是不能原谅你，我很感激她总是在店里帮忙。但是...
Why have you been calling her sister "Miss" Miria lately?=你最近为什么叫她姐姐“Miria小姐”？
And you know what people call that gem you gave her, too, don't you!?=你也知道人们怎么称呼你给她的那种宝石吧！？
Well...I was talking about it in front of the church... I mean, at the dining hall... A busty girl like Miria could easily get a guy to marry if she just dressed sexier...=这个...我在教堂前谈论...在餐厅...像Miria这样胸部丰满的女孩，只要打扮得更性感点，就很容易找个男人结婚...
Busty girl... Marry...? Don't stick your nose into other people's business, you perverted old man!=胸部丰满的女孩...？别插手别人的终身大事，你这个变态老头！
Eek...! Sorry! I didn't mean it like that!=哎呀...！很抱歉！我不是那个意思！
Those girls have been through a lot, though...=不过，那俩女孩经历了很多事啊...
Their parents died in the epidemic only two years after Ricca was born. But I guess that's what happens when a herb picker tries to play doctor...=她们的父母在Ricca出生两年后死于疫情。但我猜采药者试图扮医生就会有这类惨剧...
Back then, Miria was even younger than Ricca is now, but she was so put together.=那时，Miria甚至比现在的Ricca年少，但她很要强。
The town chipped in some money, but Miria raised Ricca pretty much on her own... I'm sure she wanted to have fun like most teenage girls, too.=镇上凑了些钱，但Miria基本上是靠自己把Ricca拉扯大...我相信她也想和大多数十几岁的女孩一样，开开心心地过童年时日。
She could've relied on others a little more...but I guess there weren't many people to rely on back then, either. A lot of people got sick.=她本可以再依赖别人一点...当时也没有多少人可以依靠。很多人都病了。
Yeah... And then some people started blaming the epidemic on Miria's family. They said that they brought the sickness when they moved in, or that someone as pretty as Miria must be a witch or a succubus...=是啊...然后一些人开始将疫情归咎于Miria的家人。说他们搬来时带来了疾病，或者，像Miria这样漂亮的人一定是女巫或魅魔...
How ridiculous. It's far more likely that the sickness was brought in by some traveler.=荒唐，胡闹！我看呐，这种病更有可能是旅行者带来的。
Exactly. As proof, I'm healthy as can be, and I've been close to them all this time! I gave the asshole who started the rumor a good punch in the face.=确实如此。我可证明，我一直和他们家的人接触，而身体健康无碍！我狠狠地打了那些造谣混蛋的脸。
That was so wonderful what you did... I wouldn't have fallen for you if it weren't for that.=你做的太棒了... 要不是因为这些正义之举，我哪会爱上你呢。
Ghahaha... Right? I used to feel so sorry for Miria back then, it was hard to even look at her. Even though she had those amazing breasts and ass...=哈哈哈...是么？那时啊，我对Miria家的事很难过，甚至很难直视她。尽管她有着惊人的胸部和屁股...
But Ricca's all grown up now. It's about time Miria settled down, so I gave her that necklace as my way of supporting her, okay? It was a pure, kindhearted gesture...=但是Ricca现在都长大了。Miria该安顿下来了，所以我给了她那条项链作为我的支持。这是纯洁、善良的表示啊...
And I'm telling you her private life is none of your business, pervert! And you were lying about how she seemed down, too!=我告诉你，她的私生活不关你的事，变态！你还撒谎说她情绪低落！
They're finally living a happy life and don't need our meddling. Let them do what they like.=她们终于过上了幸福的生活，不需要我们干涉。让她们随心所欲吧。
You think so...? I just think it's a waste that such a pretty girl hasn't found a husband yet...=我只是觉得这么漂亮的女孩还没找到丈夫，真是太可惜了...

What is it, Miria?=什么事，姐姐？
Do I trouble you with how much I worry...? Do you think I should dress flashier...?=我的担心...困扰到你了吗...？你觉得我应该穿得更华丽些吗...？
If I wore a blouse that showed my cleavage, and a frilly short skirt that exposed my thighs and just barely hid my panties, and used a sweet flirty voice when I served customers, I would easily get a husband, right?=如果我穿露出乳沟的上衣，露出大腿，几乎不遮住内裤的褶边短裙，在招待顾客时用甜美的调情声音，我会很容易找到丈夫，是不是啊？
Huh!? Wh-What makes you say... Did the merchant's wife tell you...?=噫噫！？你，你为什么这么说... 老板的妻子告诉你的吗...？
I heard her talking loud and clear. She was practically shouting in front of the house. I know full well I dress plainly, but men who are attracted to flashy girls usually aren't any good.=我听见她说的话了，真是洪亮而清晰的好嗓子啊。她就差在房子前面大喊大叫了。我很清楚我穿得很朴素，但被花哨女孩吸引的男人通常都不是好人。
I-I see... Ahaha...=我，我明白了... 啊哈哈...
*Sigh* I appreciate you worrying about me, but don't you have anyone you're interested in?=*唉*，我很感激你为我担心，但是你没有感兴趣的人吗？
Your friend Olivia from the blacksmith family married a man from the royal capital when she was around your age, so I don't think you're too young for marriage.=你的朋友Olivia，铁匠家族出身，在你这么大的时候，嫁给了一个王都男人。我觉得你现在结婚不早了。

There are no other girls around my age either. Olivia was the only one.=也没有别的女孩和我同龄。仅有Olivia一个。
I guess so... Olivia was so eager to move to the city, she spent so much time talking to travelers and trying to find a husband. It made sense though. She lost her family to the flux...=是啊...Olivia非常渴望搬到城里，所以她花了很多时间与旅行者交谈，并试图找个丈夫。不过这有道理。她在疫情中失去了家人...

(<indent%3D0.4em>My parents apparently died from it, too...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我的父母显然也死于此...）
Hey, Ricca. Have you ever thought about leaving this village? I recently had a customer from the eastern port town saying they were looking for new help to hire.=哎，Ricca。你想过离开这个村子没有？最近有位来自东部港口城镇的客户说，他们在找新的助手呢。
I have some money saved up, so if you want to, we could get you a place to live in the port town. Or maybe a young lady like you would prefer the capital?=我存了些钱，如果你愿意，我可以在港口城市给你找个地方住。还是说你这样的年轻女子更喜欢去王都么？

I see... Then how about the town in the west? I heard they have a very fine church there.=我懂了... 那西部城镇呢？那里有很美的教堂。
Isn't that town in the neighboring kingdom? I'm not interested in that place, either.=那不是邻近王国的城镇吗？我对那里也不感兴趣。
Hey, Miria... Why are you trying to get me to move...? Oh... Am I...a burden to you?=哎，姐姐...你为什么要让我搬家...？ 哦...我是...你的负担吗？
Urk, *Sniff*... You want me out of the house... Don't you...?=呜呜，*抽泣*... 你想让我走...是吗...？
I cost too much money to feed. That's why you hate me... Whaaaaaah!=供养我花的钱太多。故而你恨我... 哇啊啊啊啊！
That's not true... I don't hate you... But if you keep living in the village, every day will be just like any other day. We'll both end up as old ladies before we know it.=胡说... 我才不恨你呢... 但是如果你继续住在村子里，每一天都活得差不多。不知不觉，我们都会变成老太太啦。
Ahaha! You're exaggerating. Besides, I wouldn't mind that.=啊哈哈！你太夸张了。还有，我不介意的。
I would. Our parents in heaven will be sad if both of us die single...=我会介意的。如果我们两个都形单影只地死去，我们在天的父母会伤心啊...
I don't want you to go through the loneliness I had to.=我不想再让你经历我所经历的孤独。
Are you talking about that again? Wouldn't you be lonely if I left you and started living on my own, Miria?=你又要再讲一遍啊？如果我离开你，独自生活，姐姐你会不会再孤独呢？
Well... I might... But if it means you'll have a happy family of your own, I can put up with it.=呃... 我可能会吧... 但如果这样你能有幸福的家庭，我可以忍受嘛。
You say that, but I doubt it. Heehee! And I'm already plenty happy right now!=你是这么说的，但我持怀疑态度。 嘻嘻！而且我现在已经很开心了。
Helping out at the shop is fun, and I don't get bored of playing with Polon and the forest animals. I'm even getting a little fatter from all the delicious meals I eat...=在商店帮忙很有趣，我并不会厌倦和Polon等森林里的动物嬉戏。何况我尝过这么多佳肴，变得有点儿胖了...
I guess the only thing I want is for my sister to stop being a worrywart and give me more independence.=我唯一想做的就是不再让我姐姐忧心忡忡，让我更加独立些。
Geez...=天哪...
One week after Ricca got rid of the slimes in the mountains...=Ricca摆脱山上的史莱姆一周后...
I'm sorry to trouble you. The customers really like the herbs served with our dishes...=抱歉又要麻烦你。顾客们真的很喜欢菜里的草药...

I know, I know. I'll be careful not to trip, and I'll come back right away if I see any monsters.=我知，我知。我会小心不要绊倒，如果我看到任何怪物，我会马上回来。
Okay... As long as you understand... But I'm worried. A girl like you shouldn't be running around like a tomboy in patched clothes...=好哦... 你明白就好... 我很担心。你这样的女孩不应该像个穿着补丁衣服的假小子，\n到处乱跑...
(<indent%3D0.4em>T-Tomboy...? Did she find out about how I beat up those smiles the other day...!?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>假，假小子...? 她是否得知了我那天殴打史莱姆的情况...!)
Urk... Geez, Miria! You're so persistent! Anyway, are you working at the dining hall again in the afternoon today?=额...天啊，姐姐！你真固执啊！对了，你今天下午还在餐厅工作吗？
Oh, actually, I'm not. I have today off, so I'm thinking of cleaning the church until evening.=呃，其实我今天休息，我想打扫一天教堂。
Okay... What about dinner?=哦哦... 那晚餐吃啥？
I'll have some bean soup and bread ready with a side of tomato salad.=豆子汤和面包，外加番茄沙拉。
Hmm... Soup, bread, and tomato salad... Huh!? What!? Tomato salad!?=嗯...汤、面包和番茄沙拉...呵！？什么！？番茄沙拉！？
The merchant's wife gave me a bunch yesterday. We need to eat them before they spoil.=老板的妻子昨天给了我些柿子。要在变质之前吃掉啊。
Couldn't you put them in the soup? You know I don't like raw tomatoes...=你不能把它们放进汤里吗？你明明晓得我不喜欢生西红柿的...
I do, but you shouldn't be a picky eater. I've already prepared the beans, so give the raw tomatoes a try, okay? You might find out you actually like them.=是能放，但你不应挑食。我已经准备好豆子了，所以试试生吃西红柿，行吗？你可能会很喜欢。
No way... *Sniff*... I think tomato soup would be better... Tomatoes have slimy stuff around their seeds... Urk... *Sniff*=不可能...*抽泣*... 番茄汤更好... 番茄的种子周围有粘稠的东西啊... 呃...*抽泣*
*Sigh* Fake crying isn't going to work on me. It's about time you stopped being a picky eater.=*唉*，装哭对我没用。你该停止挑食了啊。
Whaaat? Well, fine! If you're not going to make tomato soup, I'm not going to talk to you anymore.=啥啥？好吧，行啊！你要是不做番茄汤，我就不跟你说话了。
You're acting like a child again...=你又像个孩子了...
Hmph! I hate my no-soup sister...! I'm not talking to you!=哼！我可不喜欢不做汤的姐姐...！不跟你说话了！
Ah... Ricca...=啊... Ricca...

Hmm... This fairy doll is cute, but a little too risque... It would be kinda awkward to use her as an ornament in the house...=呃...这个妖精娃娃好可爱，但有伤风化啊... 把她当成家里的装饰品会有点尴尬...
After I make up with Miria, I'll ask her to teach me how to make a little dress for her.=我和姐姐和好后，我好让她教教我怎么做一件小裙子。

Haah... Nnnhaaa... It's finally out...=哈...嗯哈...终于出来了...
Urk... I'm glad no one saw me...but I can't believe I just spread my cheeks apart to push out a slime monster...=呜... 真高兴没人看见...我不敢相信我刚扳开屁股瓣，喷挤出来个史莱姆怪物...
Haa... How am I going to...get back home with my clothes gone...? Nnhaaa, haaa... I know I'll worry Miria, but.. Haa... I'll wait until it gets dark...and sneak home...=哈...我该怎么...在无衣服的情况下回家...？嗯哈，哈...我知道Miria会担心，但是...哈...我会等到天黑...然后偷偷溜回家...

Oh!? Oooh! Oooooooooooh!?=哦哦！噢！？噢喔喔！？
(<indent%3D0.4em>I feel sick... The slimes are vigorously squirming into my tummy... Urk... I feel them coming up to my stomach...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我觉得好恶心...史莱姆们在我肚子里剧烈蠕动...呜... 我感觉到它们攀爬到肠胃上了...！）
Uff... Uuugh... Stop... Gruuuugh...=唔呼...呃...停下...咕噜...
(<indent%3D0.4em>They're lifting up...my organs...!? They're going up to my throat...! Please, stop... I'm begging you...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>它们正在抬高...我的器官...！？他们快到我喉咙了...！请停下来...我求你了...）
Four hours later...=四小时后...
Ricca, where are you? Can you hear me!? Riccaaaa!=Ricca, 你在哪儿啊？你能听见我说话吗！？Ricca啊！
Ricca! Come out, wherever you are!=Ricca! 出来吧，从哪儿都行！
Geez... It's still before sunset, Miria. You don't have to worry so much. I'm sure she just dozed off somewhere after getting back to the village...=天哪...还没到日落，Miria。你不必那么担心。我肯定她回到村子后就在什么地方打瞌睡了...

==================3D被史莱姆舔--完毕=================================

=========NOVEL哥布林口交开始=-=-===============
Mmmmgh! Nnngh! Hmmmggghhh!=唔唔唔! 嗯嗯! 嗯哼哼哼!
(<indent%3D0.4em>Aaaagh...!? I-Is this... Eek...! A goblin's...thing... He has his thing inside my mouth...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>啊啊...！？ 这，这是... 噫...! 哥布林的...玩意儿... 他给塞到我嘴里面了...)
As I raise my beaten body, the goblin grips my head and jaw and forces his genitals into my mouth.=当我想拖着被打得遍体是伤的身体站起来时，哥布林抓住我的头和下巴，强迫他的生殖器进入我的嘴里。
Khehehe! I'll beat you to death if you bite me even a little. You got that?=呵呵呵! 你再咬我一口，我就打死你。你明白我的意思吗?
Mmmmgh, mmmgh... Nnngh...=唔唔唔, 唔呃呃呃... 嗯...
Since my family is only my sister and me, the only male genitalia I've ever seen was that of my neighbor's young boy. This was my first time seeing an adult penis, even though it belonged to a demi-human.=因为我家只有我姐姐和我，我唯一见过一个男性生殖器，还是从邻居的小男孩那里。这是我第一次看到成人的阴茎，尽管他是半人类。
The neighbor's boy's was a cute triangular protrusion, much smaller and cleaner than what is currently in my mouth.=邻居家的男孩的是一个可爱的三角形突起，比我现在嘴里的要小得多，干净得多。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Urff, uugh... What is this...? It's hot...and it stinks... It's so dirty! Stop... Don't force that hard thing...into my mouth... Don't put it in...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呜，呜... 这是个啥啊...? 好烫...好难闻... 太脏啦! 停下啊... 不要强迫那个硬硬的东西...进到我嘴里... 别放进来...)
As the filthy clump of meat drives in deeper, its awful stench fills my mouth. Even while knowing the risks, I struggle and jerk my hands and feet.=当那块肮脏的肉越陷越深时，我的嘴里充满了可怕的恶臭。即使知道其中的风险，我还是挣扎着，扭动着手脚。
Nnngh... Mmnnn... Hmmngh...!=嗯嗯... 唔唔... 嗯呃...!
The green hand pulls at me all over as I try to avoid them, ripping the clothes my mother had given me before she died.=当我试图躲开他们时，那只绿手把我抓得团团转，撕扯着我母亲去世前给我的衣服。
The rip forms a gaping hole in the middle of my green dress, exposing my skin and underwear.=我的绿裙中间裂开了一个大洞，露出了我的皮肤和内衣。
Hey, you sure about this? Weren't we told not to mess with this girl?=嘿，你确定吗?我们不是被告知不要惹这女孩吗?
Hehehe, it's fine. Our shitty captain won't notice as long as we don't break her! Hey, human! You better keep quiet about this, too. If you mention this to anyone...=哈哈,没事的。只要我们不把她弄坏，我们的烂队长就不会注意到！嘿，人类！你最好也不要说出去。如果你向任何人提起这件事...
Red eyes and sharp fangs... He's so scary... Please don't glare at me...=红眼睛和尖牙... 他真吓人... 请不要怒视我。
Nnngh... Mmmn... Mnnnngh... Nnnnhh...=嗯嗯... 唔嗯... 唔唔... 嗯嗯嗯...
The goblin stares at me with its cruel face and I immediately cower in fear. My fidgeting hands and feet freeze in place.=哥布林用它那张残忍的脸盯着我，我立刻害怕地退缩了。\n我不停动弹的手脚在此刻仿佛凝结了。
Khehehe, that's right, you better obey me...human woman! I order you to service me with your mouth and tongue!=呵呵，这就对了，你最好听我的...人类女性！我命令你用你的嘴和舌头为我服务！
(<indent%3D0.4em>S-Service...? No... I don't want to suck on this thing...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>服，服务...? 不要... 吸这东西什么的...)
Miria might still tease me that I'm still a child, but my friend Olivia half-mockingly taught me about sex, so I have some sexual knowledge.=姐姐取笑我还是个孩子，但我的朋友Olivia半开玩笑地教我性爱，所以我有一些性知识。
That's how I know that this goblin is asking me to, um...give it a blow...job? I think that's what it's called.=所以我才知道这个哥布林要求我这样... 给他口... 交一个...？我想就是这么叫的。
But this is something people do when they love each other. No one would lick someone's pee hole if they weren't affirming their love for each other.=但这是人们相爱时所做的事情。如果不肯定彼此的爱，没有人会舔别人的尿道口。
The thought of putting anyone's dirty penis inside my mouth makes me sick. The fact that it's the penis of a monster that killed the people of my village makes it so much more awful.=一想到把别人的脏阴茎放进我嘴里，我就恶心。何况是一个杀死了村子民众的怪物的阴茎，事情更加可怕。
Huh...? This woman ain't moving. Maybe she doesn't know how to give you head.=呵...？这个女人一动不动。也许她不知道动脑袋。
Khehehe, I could tell from her prudish looks that she was a virgin. Fine, I'll teach you how to do it! You better thank me later!=嘿嘿嘿，从她拘谨的表情，我可以看出她是处女。好吧，我来教你怎么做！以后你最好谢谢我！
Virgin...? He's right, but...I don't want to suck on this...=处女...？他是对的，但是...我不想吸这个...
*Sshlup, sshlupp...!*=*吸溜，吸溜...！*
Mmmmnghhhhh! Nnnnngh, nngh, nnghhh!=嗯哼！嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯呢，嗯嗯嗯，嗯嗯呃呃呃！
The hands grasping my head shake me horizontally back and forth.=其手握着我的头，来回地水平摇晃。
In unison with the movement, the crotch in front of my face swings front and back, and his rod goes in and out of my mouth.=随着动作的进行，我面前的胯部前后摆动，他的棒子从我嘴里进出。
Nngh, nnssch, mmngh, hhaah.... Ssslmgh, *Gasp*, mmnghh...!=嗯，嗯，哈呣...湿噜嗯，*喘*，呣呣恩...！
(<indent%3D0.4em>It's so dirty and hot, and it keeps going in and out of me... Nnngh... I feel it in the back of my throat...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>它又脏又热，一直在进进出出我...嗯...我感觉它跑到了我的喉咙深处...！）
Every time the goblin's penis rubs against the flesh of my cheeks and throat, it leaves a trail of fluid and some kind of paste in my mouth.=每次哥布林的阴茎摩擦我的脸颊和喉咙的组织时，它都会在我嘴里留下液体和某种糊状物的痕迹。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Wh-What's this bitter taste...? It's so gross... I hate this... Urk... Is what I'm tasting...a man's... E-Ew! No! I don't want something so dirty...in my mouth...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>这是什么苦味...？太恶心了...我讨厌这个...呜... 这就是我正在品尝的...男人的...呃唔！不！我不想要这么脏的东西...在我嘴里...！）
Mmmgh... *Smooch* Nnnghaa... Schmmch, mmmngh... Mnnnh... Nnngh...=嗯*接吻*嗯吸啊...呣，嗯...嗯...嗯...
With every stroke of the penis, drool and a mixture of nasty fluids spill from the corners of my lips.=随着阴茎的每一次抽插，我的嘴角都会流出口水和肮脏液体的混合物。
The drops of mucus fall from the chin to my neck, dripping and soiling my bra and chest.=粘液滴从下巴流到我的脖子，滴落着，弄脏了我的胸罩和胸部。
Keke... Your tongue's nice and soft, but it's not stimulating enough.=咳呵呵...你的舌头挺好，很柔软，但不够刺激。
The goblin stops moving his hands and hips.=哥布林停下移动他的手和臀部。
Woman! Why'd you stop sucking and using your tongue!? Do you have a death wish?=女子！你为什么不再使用舌头吮吸！？你想活不了？
I don't want to...suck on this...thing...=我不想...吸这个...东西...
I hate it, but...if I don't...he's going to kill me...=我讨厌，但是...如果我不...他会杀了我...
I hesitate for a moment, but the goblin's loud voice strikes fear in me.=我犹豫了片刻，但哥布林的刺耳叫喊让我感到恐惧。
I suppress the urge to spit out his dick and start to caress him with my tongue.=我抑制住了吐出他的阴茎的冲动，并开始用舌头爱抚他。
Urk... Uugh... *Smooch*, *Lick*... Mmsch... *Suck*...=呜... 啊...*接吻*，*舔*...呣呣...*吸*...
Still, I don't know how I'm supposed to do this...=不过，我不知道该怎么做...
First of all, is a penis sensitive like a girl's vagina?=首先，阴茎像女孩的阴道一样敏感吗？
He'll surely get mad at me if I stimulate it too much and hurt him, so I'll just gently stroke and poke it with the tip of my tongue...=如果我刺激太狠，伤害了他，他必然会生我的气，所以我得用舌尖轻轻地抚摸和探...
*Lick*... *Lick*...=*舔*...*舔*...
Mnnnh... *Lick*... Nnnh... *Smooch*, *Lick*...=嗯...*舔*...嗯嗯...*接吻*，*舔*...
More and more of the bitter paste sticks onto my tongue.=越来越多的苦味糊粘在我的舌头上。
I hesitate to keep sucking and slow my tongue's movement.=我犹豫着继续吮吸，放慢舌头的运动。
Tsk... You fucking suck at this...!=嘶嘶...你他妈的烂透了...！
Khehehe! Hey, let's just kill this bitch.=呵呵！喂，我们杀了这个婊子吧。
Huh? But the captain said not to...=嗯？但是队长说不可...
The goblin violating my mouth turns to another goblin standing slightly far away and makes a signal.=哥布林侵犯了我的嘴，它转向另一个站在稍微远一点的哥布林，做了个手势信号。
Kheke, heeheehee, I gotcha.=呵呵，嘿嘿，我懂了。
Responding to the cue, the farther goblin picks up a sword and approaches us.=根据信号，远处的哥布林拿起剑向我们靠近。
Nngh...!? Eeeeek...!=嗯...！？哎呀...！
When the blade touches the nape of my neck, I reflexively spit out the rod in my mouth and flinch back.=当刀锋碰到我的颈背时，我本能地吐出嘴里的棒子，退缩了。
As the heavily-chipped blade slowly slides across my neck, it leaves a mark as if someone had lightly scratched it with their fingernail.=那片伤痕累累的刀片慢慢滑过我的脖子，留下了一个痕迹，就好像用指甲轻轻地刮了一下。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Th-The sword... It's cutting my neck...!? I'm gonna die... Stop...! I'm gonna bleed all over and die...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>这把剑...在割我的脖子...！？我要死了...停下啊...！我会流血而死的...！）
Surprised by the cold touch of the blade and pain, I involuntarily bend my head backward. My mouth lets go of the goblin's penis.=刀锋的冰冷触碰和疼痛吓着我了，我不由自主地向后仰头。嘴放开了哥布林的阴茎。
It seems that I'm not bleeding, but I still feel a sting from my neck.=我貌似没有流血，但我还是觉得脖子上有刺痛感。
Khehehehe, you think I can kill this girl if I cut her pasty neck four or five more times?=呵呵呵，你觉得我再割她那苍白的脖子四五次就能杀了她吗？
Eeek... Stop... Don't kill me...=哎呀...停下...别杀我...
The thought of the dull sword cutting at my neck repeatedly makes my lips tremble and my teeth chatter.=想到那把钝剑不断地在我的脖子上刺来刺去，我的嘴唇牙齿颤抖，又颤抖。
Kehehehe, if you don't want us to kill you...=呵呵呵呵，如果你不想让我们杀了你...
Urk... I-I understand... Ugh... But... I can't...=呜... 我，我明白...呃...但是...我不能...
I recall the disgusting, bitter sensation of the rod forced into my mouth.=我记得那根棒子塞进我嘴里时那种恶心、痛苦的感觉。
I don't want to die, but I detest the idea of sucking off the goblin just as much as I want to live.=我不想死，但我讨厌为了苟活而吮吸哥布林的想法。
Urk... Ugh...=呜... 呃...
Slap!=扇！
Eeek! Ack... That hurt...=哎呀！啊啊...痛死了...
A sudden impact hits my left cheek. Soon after, it stings and swells up in pain.=我的左脸颊吃了一记突然的耳光。不久之后，产生刺痛和肿胀的症状。
It was a mark left by the irritated goblin. He had slapped me with his four-fingered hand.=恼怒的哥布林留下如此痕迹。他用四个指头的手打了我一巴掌。
Ghehe. Look, bitch, I don't have much patience.=嘿嘿。听着，婊子，我没什么耐心。
If you don't hurry up, my hand might slip and accidentally cut the veins on your neck.=如果你不快点，我的手可能会滑一下，不小心割断你脖子上的静脉。
Uugh... B-But... The smell... It feels dirty on my tongue...=啊...但，但是...这股味道...我觉得舌头很脏...
The demi-human's palm hits my right cheek.=半人的手掌打到了我的右脸颊。
Stop yapping...! Come on, take it already!=别叫了...！快点，开搞啊！
The pain in my cheeks is unbearable...=我脸颊上的疼痛难以忍受...
These goblins...are really going to kill me...=这些哥布林...真的会杀了我...
I guess sucking off this disgusting thing...is still better than getting beaten to death...=我猜，吸掉这恶心的东西...还是比被打死好...
I-I'll do it, okay... So please...don't hurt me anymore... Oww... Don't slap me, please...=我，我会的，嗯嗯...所以请...别再伤害我了...哦呜呜...请不要扇我耳光...
*Suck*=*吮吸*
Mmmgh... Nnha... *Smooch*, mmmgh...=嗯...嗯哈...*接吻*，呣嗯...
I ready myself and hold the goblin's penis in my mouth.=我做好准备，把哥布林的阴茎叼在嘴里。
As the bitter taste spreads all over my tongue again, the corners of my eyes overflow with tears.=苦味再次蔓延到我的舌头上，我的眼角充满了泪水。
Khehehe! Now suck it, just like I ordered!=呵呵！现在吸吧，就像我命令的那样！
(<indent%3D0.4em>I hate this... This is mortifying... Why do I have to do this...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我讨厌这个...羞死人了...我为什么要这么做...？）
Miria would often drop hints for me to act modest, so if she knew I was being forced to suck off a monster's dick, she would be absolutely heartbroken.=姐姐经常暗示我要谦虚，如果她知道我被迫吮吸怪物的阴茎，她会非常伤心。
Yet, if I don't suck him as he tells me to, I'll be killed.=然而，如果我不按他说的那样吮吸，我会被杀的。
Mmch... Nnsch... *Smooch* Mmch... *Suuuck*...=嗯...嗯嗯...*亲吻*，嗯...*吸吸吸吸*...
Grimacing in disgust, I press my tongue against his dark red rod.=我厌恶地做了个鬼脸，把舌头贴在他深红色的棒子上。
I then wrap the center of my tongue against the underside of his penis and lick it up and down.=然后我用舌头的中心抵住他的阴茎下面，上下舔它。
Nnngh, *Smooch*... *Lick*... *Lick*... Nnngh... Nnnnmmh...=嗯嗯，*接吻*...*舔*...*舔*...嗯...嗯嗯嗯嗯...
Khehehe, you should've just sucked like this from the beginning.=呵呵呵，你从一开始就应该这样。
The goblin holding the sword returns to the pillar along the wall.=拿着剑的哥布林沿着墙回到柱子旁边。
Come on, bitch! Suck harder! Make sure you lick off all the dick cheese on the head and make it clean! And if you don't do what I say...=来，婊子！用力吸！一定要把龟头上的“奶酪”舔干净！如果你不照我说的做...
He's going to slap me again... And my neck's going to get cut, too...=他又要扇我耳光了...我的脖子也会被割伤...
Struck with fear, I tell myself to forget about the taste in my mouth and suck hard on the tip of his penis.=吓得我心惊肉跳，我告诉自己忘掉嘴里的味道，使劲吮吸他的阴茎尖。
*Smooooch*... *Suck*... Sllurrpp... *Smooch*...=*接吻*...*吸*...嗜噗...*接吻*...
A repulsive taste spreads throughout my mouth as I suck on the juices accumulated in the tip.=我吸吮了尖端积聚的汁液，一股令人厌恶的味道在我的嘴里蔓延开来。
*Smooch* Nnn... *Smooch*... Mmmch... *Smooch*...=*接吻*嗯...*接吻*...嗯...*接吻*...
I don't know what the goblin means by "cheese," but I'll be killed if I don't lick off the filth stuck on it.=我不知道哥布林说的“奶酪”是什么意思，但如果我不舔掉粘在上面的污垢，我会被杀的。
Thinking I've found the spot, I tilt my head a little and lick the groove of the cap-shaped part of his rod, cleaning the white buildup.=我觉得自己找到了污点，于是把头稍微歪了一下，舔了舔他棍子帽状部分的凹槽，清理棒子的白色碎屑。
Ngh, *Lick*, schmmmch, *Lick*, schmck, *Lick*... *Smooch*, *Lick*... Mmnnch, schmm...=嗯，*舔*，嗜呣呣嗜，*舔*，嗜呣，*舔*...*接吻*，*舔*...嗯，嗜..
The more I lick, the more disgusting paste gets stuck on my tongue.=我越舔，舌头上粘的东西就越恶心。
No matter how hard I try to avoid thinking about it, I can't stop noticing the bitterness that washes over my tongue.=无论我多么努力地避免去想，我还是会注意到在我舌头上冲刷着的苦涩。
Tears build up in my eyes and nausea overwhelms me, but I remind myself that this is better than dying. I alternate between sucking on the tip and cleaning the underside.=眼泪涌上我的眼睛，恶心的感觉淹没了我，但我提醒自己，这总比死去要好。我一边吮吸尖端，一边清洗下面。
*Smooch*, mmmch... Nnnch, *Smooch*... *Suck*... *Lick*... Nnngh, mmch... *Lick*... *Smooch*...=*接吻*，嗯...嗯嗯，*接吻*...*吸*...*舔*...嗯，嗯...*舔*...*接吻*...
Huff... Huff... You're getting good at this... Khehehe... You'll make a great mouth urinal, slut!=呼呼...呼呼...你越来越擅长了...呵呵...你会成为一个很棒的肉便器的，荡妇！
A-A urinal...?=肉，肉便器...？
My body... My mouth...isn't a toilet...=我的身体...我的嘴...不是厕所...
Khehehe! You're right, this girl's got a great body! She's got a face of a child, but her ass is so big and plump, it's like it's seducing us!=呵呵！你说得对，这个女孩身材很好！她有童颜，但她的屁股又大又丰满，好像在引诱我们！
The goblin with the sword had apparently been looking at my butt through my ripped clothes.=拿着剑的哥布林显然一直在透过我撕破的衣服看我的屁股。
I was also aware that my butt had grown larger, but having it pointed out in such a frank, crude way makes my body hotter.=我也意识到我的屁股变大了，但用如此坦率、粗鲁的方式指出，让我的身体更热了。
*Sniff* *Sniff* Huff, huff... What a lewd scent... Khehehehe, I'm starting to get excited too...=*嗅**嗅* 呼呼，呼呼...多么淫秽的气味...呵呵，我也开始兴奋了...
(<indent%3D0.4em>Huh...!? I-Is he sniffing the smell of my butt...!?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呵...！？他，他闻到我屁股的味道了吗...！？)
My body had already been hot from the constant running around in the village, but being forced to do this naughty service had covered my whole body in sweat.=由于在村子里不停地跑来跑去，我的身体已经很热了，被迫做这种淫秽的服务，更让我全身出汗。
I can't turn around, so I don't know what's going on behind me, but imagining the goblin sniffing such an embarrassing spot makes my body temperature rise even more.=我无法转身，所以不知道身后发生了什么，但想象那哥布林嗅到这样一个尴尬的地方，我的体温更高了。
Slllrrpp! Slllrrpp slllrrpp!=唔噗！唔噗唔噗！
Mmmph, Nnnmmmphhh...! *Suck*... Hmmmnn, Nnnchnnn... Mnnnnn! Mnnhhh! *Suck*...!=嗯，嗯嗯嗯...！*吸*...嗯嗯，嗯...呣呣！嗯！*吸*...！
While distracted by the embarrassment, my blurry field of view suddenly shakes.=当我因为尴尬而分心时，我模糊的视野突然抖动起来。
The goblin thrusting his penis in me has grabbed my head and started shaking it back and forth.=哥布林把他的阴茎插入我，抓住我的头，开始来回摇晃。
At the same time, he violently rocks his hips in front of my eyes and pumps his penis in me like a piston.=与此同时，他在我眼前剧烈地摇晃着他的臀部，像活塞一样把他的阴茎插入我体内。
Keep sucking and licking at it, mouth urinal!=继续吮吸和舔，肉便器！
(<indent%3D0.4em>Ugh, he called me a urinal again... I'm not like that... Aaah... I'm getting dizzy... I'm suffocating... It's so dirty... I can taste the disgusting juices flooding my mouth...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>他又叫我肉便器了...我不是那样的...啊...我头晕...我快窒息了...太脏了...我能尝到令人恶心的汁液从嘴里涌出来...）
Schmmk... Nnchh... *Suck*... *Smooch*... Nnnnhhmm...!=嘛唔...嗯...*吸*...*接吻*...嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯...！
My saliva dissolves the filth and fluids coming from the tip, and the unpleasant taste spreads throughout my mouth.=我的唾液溶解了从尖端流出的污垢和液体，不愉快的味道扩散到我的整个口腔。
I feel a sting in the back of my nose from smelling the tainted saliva overflowing from the corners of my mouth.=闻到从嘴角溢出的受污染的唾液，我感到鼻子后部刺痛。
I desperately want to spit it all out, but I suppress the urge and continue to suck.=我拼命想把它吐出来，但我抑制住了冲动，继续吮吸。
Khehehe... I'm gonna blow my load! Don't let go of my cock, you got that!?=呵呵...我要泻出我的存货了！别放开我的老二，明白吗！？
(<indent%3D0.4em>Blow...his load...? What does he... Oh... Oh no...! No, absolutely not! Noooooooooo!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>泻出他的存货...？他什么...哦...哦别...！不，绝对不能！不不不不不不！)
Semen... The white mucus that creates babies...=精液...创造婴儿的白色粘液...
I've seen the cattle and sheep kept at the village mate before, so even I know what that is... I know, but...=我以前见过在村里养的牛羊，所以就连我都知道那是什么...我知道，但是...
*Splurt! Splurt! Spluuuurrrrt!*=*喷溅！喷溅！喷溅溅溅溅溅溅！*
Nnnngh, mmmmmggghhhhhhh!=嗯，呣额嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯！
A hot liquid is ejected from the tip of the penis.=热液体从阴茎尖端喷出。
Its sharp bitter taste spreads throughout my mouth. I reflexively try to move my head away from the goblin's crotch.=它刺鼻的苦味传遍了我的口腔。我本能地试着把头从哥布林的胯部移开。
Ghehehe... Ooooooh!=嘿嘿...噢！
But my head is firmly held by his two hands, and instead of moving away from the goblin, my face is pressed against his filthy pubic hair.=但我的头被他的双手牢牢地抓住，我的脸没有离开那哥布林，而是紧贴着他肮脏的阴毛。
(<indent%3D0.4em>It's so bitter...and it stinks... I can't breathe...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>太苦了...而且很臭...我喘不过气来...！）
As my nose is buried in his bush, I almost pass out from the stench. It smells like cheese that has been fermented for too long.=由于我的鼻子埋在他的毛丛里，我几乎在恶臭中昏倒。闻起来像是发酵太久的奶酪。
Grrufff...!=咕噜...！
*Shloop...!*=*噬噜...！*
After nearly ten seconds of ejaculation, the goblin finally lets go of my head.=在近10秒的射精后，哥布林终于放开了我的头。

I tilt my head back and desperately move my tongue to produce saliva to help the sticky mixture down my throat.=我把头往后仰，拼命地移动舌头，分泌唾液，让粘稠的混合物顺着喉咙流下去。
Uurk... Ugh... Nnnck... Mnnngh... Nnngh... *Gulp*... *Gulp*...!=呜呜...呃...嗯呣...嗯...嗯...*啜饮*... *啜饮*...!
Tears fall from my face as I try to suppress the overwhelming sense of nausea. I finally finish swallowing all the mucus in my mouth.=泪水从我的脸上滑落，我试图抑制住难以抗拒的恶心感。我终于把嘴里的粘液都咽了下去。

(<indent%3D0.4em>I'm so sorry, Miria...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我很抱歉，姐姐...)

For as long as I could remember, she had told me that she wanted me to make a happy family, much like the one we had when our parents were still alive.=在我记忆中，她一直告诉我，她希望我能组建一个幸福的家庭，就像我们父母在世时的家庭一样。
I still don't have someone I like, but I hoped that someday I would marry a wonderful man and make Miria proud of me.=我仍然没有喜欢的人，但我希望有一天我能嫁给很棒的男人，让他成为我的爱人，让姐姐为我骄傲。

The holes in my dress are torn even further, and my underwear is ripped off, exposing my breasts.=我衣服上的洞被撕得更厉害，我的内衣被撕破，露出了我的胸部。
Ghehehe! If you struggle, we'll stab you through your tits and chest!=嘿嘿！你要是挣扎，我就刺穿你的乳头和胸部！
Eeek...! D-Don't... Ack..!=哎呀...！别，别...啊...！
The end of the goblin's sword touches the exposed tip of my breast.=哥布林之剑的末端触到了我裸露的胸口。
The dull point of the blade pushes into my flesh.=刀锋的钝尖刺进了我的肉里。
Is he going to cut it off, or pierce the sword into my heart?=他是要砍断，还是要把剑刺进我的心脏？
My body shivers and stiffens as the fear of death rushes through.=对死亡的恐惧涌上心头，我的身体颤抖僵硬。
Khehehe. This human might have the face of a kid, but she's got some sexy tits. Her nipples look tasty...=嗬嗬。这个人可有童颜，性感的乳头。看起来很涩涩...
Ghehehe, I should have made her give me a tit job instead of a blowjob...=嘿嘿，我不用口交，让她给个乳交就好...
Khehehehe, they look real soft, hehe... Her nipples are quivering. I think they want us to play with them.=呵呵，真的很柔软，呵呵...乳头在颤抖，她们希望我们和她们一起玩呢。

As my legs open, my ripped skirt is pushed up, exposing my crotch.=我双腿张开，撕破的裙子被翻了起来，露出了我的胯部。
I was already mortified by the goblins starting at my breasts, but the embarrassment from showing them my privates is unbearable.=哥布林盯着我的胸部已经让我很难堪了，但让他们看我的私处的尴尬是难以忍受的。
Reflexively, I try to lift my knees to cover myself.=本能地，我试着抬起膝盖来遮盖自己。
Hey!=卧槽！
*Scraaaape....*=*铿*
The sound of metal scraping the stone floor echoes around the room as the goblin brings his sword up with his right hand again.=哥布林再次用右手举起剑，金属刮擦石头地板的声音在房间里回荡。
The fear of death, and my chastity in danger.=对死亡的恐惧，我的贞操岌岌可危。

But now that I see the sword approaching me, fear takes over my heart. I can't possibly choose death.=但现在我看到剑向我逼近，恐惧占据了我的心。我不可能选择死亡。
I release the tensions in my legs and let my thighs give in to gravity.=我释放双腿的张力，让大腿屈服于重力。

He pushes my knees open even further, placing me in a position where my privates are defenselessly in full view.=他把我的膝盖进一步推开，使我处于一个可以毫无防备地可被看到私处的位置。

They are my favorite pair of underwear. About six months ago, Miria had brought them back as souvenirs from her visit to a faraway town.=它们是我最喜欢的内衣。大约六个月前，姐姐从一个遥远的小镇回来时，将其作为纪念品送给了我。
Poke... Poke, poke...=捅戳，戳，戳...

The goblin sitting between my legs is poking at the crotch of my panties with his long nails.=坐在我两腿之间的哥布林用他的长指甲戳着我内裤的缝隙。

I knew it... This goblin is planning to rape me...=我就知道...这个哥布林计划强奸我...
Oh? Khehehehe, is this where your piss hole is?=哦？呵呵呵，这是你的尿孔吗？
Huh...!? Ah, nooo... nnngh!=呵...！？啊，不...嗯！
The monster moves his fingers over the cloth as if he's searching for something.=怪物在布料上移动手指，好像在寻找什么东西。
Judging by what he just said, he must be looking for the entrance of the vagina.=从他刚才说的判断，他一定是在寻找阴道的入口。
It must be here! Ghehehehehe!=一定在这儿！嘿嘿嘿嘿！
*Squeeeze...!*=*挤压...！*
Eeeeeeek! Stop...! Aaaack, nnggggh...! Nnnghaaa... Aaaaaah!=哎呀！停下...！哎呀，嗯嗯嗯...！嗯啊啊...啊啊！
I had misread the goblin. Instead of poking at me, he squeezes hard on the hood of my clitoris over my underwear.=我误判了哥布林。他没有捅我，而是在用力挤压遮罩我阴蒂的内衣。
Because of the goblins' crudely stares and verbal abuse, blood has rushed into my crotch from anxiety and shame. My clit is starting to get plump and hard.=由于哥布林粗鲁的凝视和辱骂，我的胯部因焦虑和羞愧而充血。我的阴蒂开始变得又丰满又坚挺。
(<indent%3D0.4em>N-Not there...! Don't pluck at it so hard!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>不，不在那里...！别使劲拽！）
About once a month, I masturbate in secret, but even then I only stroke it gently.=大约一个月一次，我秘密地自慰，但即便如此，我也只是轻轻地抚摸她。
But now, my clit is being crushed and squeezed under my underwear. He's even rolling it between his fingers and playing with it like a toy.=但现在，我的阴蒂被挤压在内衣下面。他甚至用手指滚搓她，像玩玩具一样。

Aaah... Aaah, nnngh... Stop... It hurts... Aaaah! Stop fiddling with me...!=啊...啊，嗯...停下...很痛...啊！别再摆弄我了...！

My clit is finally freed from the pain when the fingers let go of my crotch.=手指放开我的胯部，我的阴蒂终于摆脱了疼痛。
Khehehe. Look how wet she is...!=嗬嗬。看她多湿啊...！
Surprised by the goblin's remark, I focus on my crotch and notice that my vagina actually does feel moist.=被哥布林的话惊呆了，我集中注意力到我的胯部，发现我的阴道确实潮湿了。

No... I'm not like that... I would never feel good from getting played with by a terrifying monster...=不不.. 我不是那样的...被一个可怕的怪物玩弄，我永远都不会感觉舒服...
*Shlippp...*=*拨弄*
Fingers crawl above my crotch cloth once again.=手指再一次爬到我的遮羞布上。
This time, they stimulate my labia and the entrance of my vagina instead of the clitoris.=这一次，它们刺激我的阴唇和阴道入口，而不是阴蒂。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Urk, so he's going to touch me there too... That place is for babies... I shouldn't let anyone but the person I love touch it... Please... Make this stop...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呜, 他也会碰我那里...那个地方是给婴儿的...除了我爱的人，我不应该让任何人碰它...请停下来...）
*Shlip, shlip...*=*拨弄，拨弄...*
Every time the fingers crawl over me, I feel a slightly sticky sensation and hear a wet sound.=每次手指在我身上爬行，我都会有一种轻微的黏糊糊的感觉，并听到一种潮湿的声音。
Nnnh... No... Stop... Nnngh...=嗯嗯...不要.. 停下...嗯...
The stain on my crotch gradually grows larger as more juice flows out from the depths of my vagina.=更多的汁液从阴道深处流出，我胯部的污渍逐渐变大。
Haa... Haa... Not there... Nooo... Aaann... Nnnh... Don't...=哈...哈...不在那里...不...啊...嗯嗯...不要...
Broken breaths and sweet moans leak out of my mouth.=断断续续的呼吸和甜蜜的呻吟从我嘴里漏了出来。
There is no denying it; my body is feeling pleasure from the goblin's tickling fingers.=不可否认，我的身体从哥布林挠痒痒的手指中感受到快乐了。
I don't want to admit it... Moaning will only encourage the goblin, too...=我不想承认...呻吟也只会鼓励哥布林...
Nnn... Haaan, haaa... Aaah...=嗯...哈啊，哈...啊...
The goblin's finger repeatedly rubs the center of the stain on my vaginal area.=哥布林的手指反复摩擦我阴道上污渍的中心区域.
Khehe... You won't stop leaking... Let me hear your lewd moans! You know you're feeling it, slut!=呵呵..你泄得停不下来...让我听听你淫秽的呻吟！你知道你觉到性了，荡妇！
(<indent%3D0.4em>I'm not feeling it... I don't like how the monster's fingers feel on me at all... I'm not going to moan for him...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我没有感觉到...我一点也不喜欢怪物的手指在我身上的感觉...我不会为他娇喘...）
*Shlick... Shlick... Shlick...!*=*触及...触及...触及*
Hey, you better be careful. If you keep poking at it, you might rip the cloth down there.=哇，你最好小心点。你一直戳它，可能会把那里的布扯下来。
What, are you worried about what that shitty captain will think? Fine... Khehehe, let's just take them off, then. They're in the way.=你担心那个混蛋队长会怎么想吗？好的...呵呵，那我们就将其脱掉吧。反正挡道了。
Aaah...! Eeeeeek! D-Don't strip me...! Stop...! Stoooop...!=啊...！哎哎哎呀！不，不要剥我的衣服...！停下...！哦...！
The goblin grabs onto the underwear that covers my privates and forcibly pulls them off from my thighs.=哥布林抓住我的私处内衣，用力把它从我的大腿上扯下来。
I try to resist, but with three monsters surrounding me, I'm too frightened to move. I can't do anything to stop my crotch from becoming exposed.=我试图反抗，但有三个怪物围着我，我吓得不敢动。我无法阻止我的胯部暴露。

Ooow... Don't look at it... You're not supposed to look at it...=哦唔...别看它...你不应该看它...
Tears overflow from humiliation and shame as the goblins crudely laugh and stare at my exposed privates.=哥布林们粗鲁地笑着，盯着我裸露的私处，羞辱让我泪流满面。
Goblins are green demi-humans that are slightly smaller than human men. They kidnap women and force them to bear their children.=哥布林是比人类稍小的绿色半人。他们绑架妇女并强迫她们生育子女。
All children born from mating with a goblin turn into goblins due to the magic they carry. They are atrocious monsters that increase in number the more victims they have.=所有与哥布林交配而生的孩子都会因为其魔法而变成哥布林。他们是残暴的怪物，受害者越多，他们的数量就增加得越快。
I can't even put a finger inside me when I wash my privates because it hurts too much. I'm going to break if those goblins try to stick their thick penises inside me...=我洗私处的时候连一根手指都插不进去，因为太疼了。如果哥布林想把他们粗粗的阴茎插进我的肚子里，我会崩溃的...
And right now, those terrible creatures are looking at my privates with bulging erections.=现在，那些可怕的生物正看着我勃起的私处。
(<indent%3D0.4em>No... The goblins... Their penises got bigger... Are they...g-going to put those...in me...? Are they planning to...make babies...with me....?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>不要... 哥布林...的阴茎变大了...他们要...要把这些...用在我身上...？他们打算...和我一起...生孩子...？）
And on top of that, they're going to get me pregnant...=最重要的是，他们会让我怀孕...
What was I...even living for all this time...?=我这辈子...活了这么久，可是...？
If I had gone to the city like Olivia, just like Miria recommended, I wouldn't be in this situation...=如果我听了姐姐的，像Olivia一样去了城市，我就不会处于这种情况...
Tsk. I know it's the captain's orders, but it's such a waste that we can't fuck this great hole.=嘶。我知道这是队长的命令，但这太浪费了，我们不能操这个大洞。
Huh...? Can't fuck...? So they aren't going to...?=呵...？不能操...？所以他们不会...？

Ghehehe, damn that fucking captain... Whatever, I'll just make do with her asshole...=嘿嘿，该死的队长...不管怎样，我将就着用她的屁眼对付哇...
A... Asshole...!?=屁，屁眼...！？
N-No way... Y-You're going to...p-put it in my butt...!?=不，不可能...你要...把它放，放在我屁股里...！？
I know that some people do that during sex...=我知道有些人在做爱的时候会这么玩...
But when Olivia told me about it, I thought it would never affect me, so I just laughed and made fun of it.=但Olivia告诉我这种事的时候，我以为这永远不会影响到我，所以我只是笑笑，拿它开玩笑。
N-No... N-Not my butt...=不，不.. 别，别进来我的屁股...
Not yet. It looks too tight and painful to fuck it now. Heehee!=还不可以。太紧了，现在做爱太痛了。嘿嘿！
(<indent%3D0.4em>That's not my butt... A-Are they going to put it in my vagina after all!? No... I don't know what's going on anymore... I hate this...!)=(<indent%3D0.4em>并非我的屁股...他，他们毕竟还是要插进我的阴道吗！？不要... 不知道咋回事儿...我讨厌这个...！）
The goblin who said he will be putting it in my butt was pressing his penis against my vagina.=那个说要插进我屁股里的哥布林把他的阴茎按在了我的阴道上。
Ugh... P-Please don't put it in... Urk... It's hot... Eeek... It feels gross... Aaah... Let me go already...!=呃...请不要把它抵在...呜... 很热...哎呀...很恶心...啊...让我走吧...！
My body instinctively rejects the sight of the transparent liquid coming out from the tip. I pull back my waist in an attempt to save my virginity.=我的身体本能地拒绝看到透明液体从尖端流出。我缩回腰部，试图保住我的童贞。
Hey, bitch! I told you to stay still! You humans don't have the right to talk back to goblins!=嘿，婊子！我叫你别动！你们人类无权和哥布林顶嘴！
Oww...!=哦...！
A green palm swings down from above and slaps my tummy.=一只绿色的手掌从上方垂下，拍打着我的肚子。
I close my eyes involuntarily from the loud sound, but thanks to the recent increase in fat around that area, it doesn't hurt too bad.=我不由自主地闭上了眼睛，因为声音很响，但还好最近周围区域脂肪增加了些, 不太疼。
*Push... Puuuuush...*=*推...推推推...*
However, the goblin doesn't withdraw his hand after he slaps me and instead presses his weight onto my stomach.=然而，哥布林打了我一巴掌后，并未收回手，而是继续施加重量。
Aaagh... Uuugh... Aaaah... Aaaaaaack... Uufff... Uurk... Ooooogh... Uuughaaaaa...!=啊...呃...啊...唉唉唉唉啊...唔呼...呃呃...哦哦...啊...啊...！
As the pressure against my diaphragm increases, it becomes harder to breathe, and I let out sounds that no respectable girl should make.=随着横膈膜压力的增加，呼吸更加困难，我发出了任何体面女孩都不会发出的声音。
You better not move, or it'll actually go in! Kheehee! I'm using your pussy juice to wet my cock, so keep wetting it!=你最好别动，否则它真的会进去的！呵呵！我在用你的穴汁弄湿我的老二，所以继续变湿润点！
*Push!*=*推！*
Haauuuugh...!=哈哦哇...！
*Tinkle tinkle...=*撒尿撒尿...*
A small spray of urine splashes out of me from having my abdomen squeezed.=腹部被挤压后，一小股尿液喷涌而出。
The impact on my stomach takes away strength from my entire body, and the will to protect my virginity withers.=对我小腹的冲击，带走了我整个身体的力量，我保护童贞的意志也枯萎了。
Haa... Haa... Aah, ugh... Hick... Uuugh... Please don't...hurt me anymore... I won't move... I'll stay still, so please... *Sniff*...=哈...哈...啊，呃...嘤嘤...呃...请不要...再伤害我...我不会动了...我会保持安静，求你了...*抽泣*...

Please, don't hit me... I'm so afraid...=求你了，别打我...我害怕...
Ugh... *Sniff*... Urk... Aaah... Aaagh...=呃...*抽泣*...呜... 啊...啊...
The goblin's penis continues to rub against my vagina, now wet with my urine and a small amount of vaginal fluid.=哥布林的阴茎继续摩擦我的阴道，现在被我的尿液和少量阴道液体弄湿了。
Along with the wet sounds, I can feel a ticklish pleasure coming from below. Whether I liked it or not, it was true that I was turned on by the goblin's fingers.=伴随着潮湿的声音，我能感觉到一种从下面传来的痒痒的快感。不管我喜欢与否，哥布林的手指确实让我兴奋了。
Khehe, you should have just obeyed me from the start. Stupid bitch...=呵呵，你从一开始就应该服从我。蠢婊子...
No matter how long I wait, I do not feel a penis enter me, nor the vaginal pain I'm expecting.=无论我等待多久，我都感觉不到阴茎进入我体内，也感觉不到我臆想的阴道疼痛。
I want to feel relieved that they aren't going to take my virginity...=我想松一口气，因为他们不会夺走我的童贞...
But I know that if they aren't going to penetrate my vagina, they are going to put it in my butthole as they threatened...=但我知道如果他们不想刺穿我的阴道，他们会像威胁我说的一样，插进我的屁眼里...
Aah... Aaaah... Ugh... Aaaaaaaah...=啊...啊...呃...啊啊啊...
The goblin presses the tip of his penis against my butthole and it begins to enter me.=哥布林把他的阴茎前段按在我的屁股孔上，它开始进入我的身体。
Khehehe... I'm gonna put my cock in your shithole...=嗬嗬...我要把我的老二放进你的排泄洞...

The goblin continues to push his penis into my anus.=哥布林继续把他的阴茎插入我的肛门。
Although the penis is able to push itself in a little, my hole is tightly clenched from fear. As he presses, my hips lift off the floor and my body rises with it.=虽然阴茎能够自行推入少许，但我的洞因为害怕而紧紧地收缩了。当他按压时，我的臀部抬离地板，身体也随之上升。
Fuck, this girl's asshole's so tight, I can't push it in... Hey, help me keep her down!=妈的，这女孩的屁股太紧了，我插不进去...嘿，帮我把她压下去！
Alright, khehe. Just make it quick, will ya?=好的，嗬嗬。快点，好吗？
Khehe... Yeah, you betcha!=呵呵...没错的哦！
Another goblin who had been watching me from the side holds my shoulders down.=另一个平素在旁看着的哥布林把我的肩膀压了下来。
Then the goblin who has his penis pressed to my anus thrusts his hips with more force than before.=然后那个哥布林把他的阴茎压在我的肛门上，用更大的力量插入我的臀部。
N-No... Ouch... Don't try to stick it in...! Stop... It hurts, ow, ow, oooww!=不，不要... 哎哟...别试着插进去...！停下...疼，噢，噢，噢唔！
My contracted anus begins to be pushed up by the head of the penis.=我收缩的肛门开始被阴茎头向上推搡。
Having my clenched anus forcefully spread open is painful, even though his penis is wet, especially with my body frozen with fear and tension.=尽管他的阴茎是事先润滑，但把紧锁的肛门用力张开是痛苦的，尤其是在我的身体因恐惧、紧张而僵硬的情况下。
Khehehehe! You're still too tight, damn it!=呵呵呵！你还是太紧了，该死！
As the goblin lifts me, my bodyweight presses against his penis.=哥布林举起我，我的体重压在他的阴茎上。
*Squeeze... Squeeeeeze...*=*挤...挤挤挤...*
Aaaaaaaagh! Eeeeeeeek! It hurts, I can't...! It huuuuuurts!=啊啊！哎呀！很痛，我不能...！痛痛痛痛痛！
The opening of my hole is forced open, and the tip of the penis finally enters me completely.=我的洞被强行打开，最终阴茎末端完全进入我体内。
Aaaagh, it hurts... Ooww... Aaaagh...=啊，好痛...哦...啊...

Aaaaah...! Noooooooo...! Ow, it hurts! Don't push it in anymore...!=啊啊...！不不不不不...！哦，疼！别再把它推进去了...！
Once the head of the penis spread the entrance open, the rest of it slipped into the anus smoothly.=一旦阴茎的头部打开入口，其余部分就顺利地滑入肛门。
Uuugh... Nnnhaa... Nnnngh... Haaaaa... Ooooowww... Haaaa...=呃...嗯啊啊...嗯...哈啊啊...哦哦哦...哈哈...
As the penis enters deep into my intestines, all I can do is breathe heavily in response to the pain and pressure in my butt.=阴茎深入我的肠道，我所能做的就是对臀部的疼痛和压力做出沉重的呼吸。
Ghehehehe! The line's backed up, so I'm gonna cum in you as soon as I can!=嘿嘿嘿！排着队呢，所以我会尽快内射你！
*Shlllppp...!*=*咻咻*

Just like when my mouth was violated, the goblin moves his hips to push and pull his penis inside my anus.=就像我的嘴被侵犯那样，哥布林扭胯，在我的肛门内推拉他的阴茎。
Every time he thrusts, I am attacked by pain, pressure, and a sensation similar to defecation.=每次他冲刺，我都会尝到疼痛、压力和类似排便的感觉。

Eeegh... It hurts... My butt... Haaa... My clit... Let me gooooo...!=哎呀...痛...我的屁股...哈...阴蒂...让我走————...！
The grip on my clitoris causes both pain and pleasure, and the sensation makes my vagina overflow with juice.=紧抓阴蒂带来疼痛和愉悦，这种感觉让我的阴道溢满汁液。
Blood and intestinal fluids were scraped out of my anus. Although the pain was still stronger, a relief similar to defecation was felt every time the penis moved inside me.=血液和肠液从我的肛门里被刮了出来。虽然疼痛更强烈，但每次阴茎在我体内移动时，都能感觉到类似排便的舒缓。

I'm disgusted at the goblin greedily sucking on my breasts like he's trying to devour them.=我讨厌哥布林试图吞食一样贪婪地吮吸我的乳房。
Yet when he licks my nipples with his gritty tongue, I am struck by a sweet numbing sensation.=然而，当他用他粗犷的舌头舔我的乳头时，我被一种甜蜜的麻木感觉震撼。

A girl who lives in a mountain village. While her lifestyle may not be extravagant, she and her older sister, Miria, live together happily with the help of their fellow villagers. She usually either works as a clerk at her village's general store or gathers herbs in the mountains. She often argues with her older sister who still treats her like a child, but deep down she really loves her. \r\nTravelers often come in search of food or lodging from a large mountain road that runs near the village. The village youngsters tend to listen closely to the words of travelers and long for the world outside the village, but Ricca is generally uninterested and prefers to take things at her own pace.=在山村中居住的少女。虽并不富裕，但在村民们的帮助下和姐姐Miria二人幸福地生活着。平常会帮助村里的杂货店看店、在山上采摘草药。虽然对Miria总把自己当作小孩子看待表现出不满情绪，但心里却最喜欢了。\r\n翻过村子附近的山后就是街道，在那里有旅行者前来吃住。村里的年轻人听着从他们那里传来的城市状况而对外面的世界心生憧憬，但有自己想法的Ricca却对这些并没什么兴趣。
The most beautiful girl in the village and Ricca's gentle older sister. She is {{A}} years older than Ricca and usually works in the cafeteria. After losing their parents to an epidemic, she did everything in her power to raise Ricca, who was still a child. She has since mellowed out, but she used to be very emotional, shy and had a very strong sense of duty. \r\nLegends of a fallen kingdom have been passed down by refugees for hundreds of years. A rundown church from that time still stands within the village. The church is still used to this day. Miria currently cleans and manages it in place of the elderly village mayor and his wife.=村里最漂亮的温柔美人，是Ricca的姐姐。比Ricca大１０岁，平常在食堂工作。由于父母都死于流行病所以拼命地养大了幼小的Ricca。是个虽然现在冷静下来了但曾表现出的强大责任感让村里人尽皆知的少女。\r\n村子里有着几百年前灭亡的王国的残党兴建并传承下来，现在作为遗迹的教堂残留着。教堂现在仍在使用着，年迈的村长夫妻拜托Miria代替他们打扫和管理着。
The form taken by Ricca after transforming using the power of the brooch given to her by "God." \r\nThrough divine magical protection, Ricca's soft, light body now contains strength on par with a muscular adult male. Her endurance and recovery capabilities have also improved drastically. \r\nRicca's sun-shaped brooch is enchanted with a variety of spells. It enhances Ricca's abilities by absorbing magic, allowing her to fight against monsters on a more equal footing.=只是个村姑的Ricca用从『神明大人』那里授予的宝石的力量变身之后的姿态。\r\n由于神圣魔力的加护，可以让少女那轻盈柔软的身体像久经锻炼的成年男性一样强大，和变身前相比耐久力和恢复力都大幅提升了。\r\n太阳形状的宝石可以释放多种法术，吸收了魔力之后能力也会壮大，和魔物战斗时就能占据上风。

The form taken by Ricca after fully drawing out the latent holy knight energy contained within her brooch by combining the magic of humans, monsters and darkness. Due to the tremendous magic expenditure of this form, it may be difficult for the newly-transformed Ricca to handle, but if she were to obtain complete control over it, her power could exceed even that of a god.=从Claret的水晶球中获得的人类的魔力、在大门那里吸收到的暗之魔力，以全身的咒印为媒介从魔石中吸收的魔物的魔力集合，将胸针中圣骑士的力量最大化的Ricca的姿态。魔力的消耗十分激烈，刚变身的Ricca无法处理这股力量，如果能完全驾驭这般强大的力量的话怕是会比肩神明。
A fairy who traveled from the high mountains in search of the one chosen to be the holy knight. A mystic who uses restorative and illusion magic to aid her allies in combat. \r\nBecause she was still relatively young amongst fairy kind, whose lifespans far exceed those of humans, it was believed she would be capable of adapting to the world of humans. Thus she was given the mission of providing support for the holy knight by "God". \r\nDespite being a kind girl who cares for her friends at heart, the importance of her mission weighs heavily on her shoulders, often causing her expression to grow stern.=从高山地带来寻找被选中的圣骑士的妖精。拥有可以恢复、幻惑以及战斗辅助用的神秘力量。\r\n在比人类寿命长的多的妖精一族中她是很年轻的一员，期待拥有能适应人类世界的温柔，从『神明大人』那里接受了协助圣骑士的使命。\r\n这个原本在同族中公认的温柔的女性。在认识到自己肩负的神明大人授予的使命的重要性时她的表情中危机感多了起来。
A mage girl who saved Ricca when she was being attacked by orcs. Polite and diligent. In order to focus on her magic research she currently lives in isolation, away from villages and towns. She feels lonely because she doesn't have any friends. Her parents are both renowned mages - her father specializing in restorative magic and her mother in attack magic. Claret herself received special education from a young age and is able to use a wide variety of magic. Her parents were summoned to the capital in an effort to deal with the monster problem, so Claret currently lives alone, protecting her isolated home while eliminating nearby monsters.=救助了被兽人袭击的Ricca的魔法师少女。严肃且有礼貌。为了研究魔法而在远离城市和村庄的土地上生活着，但没有朋友在还是会让她感到寂寞。父母是因为回复魔法和攻击魔法而闻名于世的魔法师。Claret自己也在很小的时候接受了精英教育，各种魔法都可以使用。父母因对抗魔物而被王都召集走了，Claret就在这不毛之地一人守护着家，退治着魔物。
A sheepdog that was raised in Ricca's village. Because herding was handled by his brothers and due to the increasing number of monsters around the village, he was allowed to roam free, acting as a guard dog. \r\nClever, and friendly to humans, he has been Ricca's closest playmate ever since the blacksmith's daughter, Olivia, left the village.=Ricca村里养着的牧羊犬。但牧羊的话用它的兄弟们就够了，村子周边的魔物多起来之后就把它作为宠物狗养着了。\r\n它聪明又友善，在锻造店的女儿Olivia结婚并离开村子后，它就是Ricca最好的玩伴了。
A servant created by an evil necromancer who fitted a puppet made of soil and stone with a core crystal containing the soul of an unknown entity. Is loyal to its master's will and possesses immensely powerful arms. \r\nEven for a holy knight whose body is stronger than that of a normal human, escaping from its sturdy arms would prove difficult. Those taken captive would find escape difficult; their vain struggles would only exhaust them and ultimately hasten their conveyance to the golem's master. Even so, if the captured prey insisted on maintaining its resistance, then...=邪恶的死灵法师用岩石和泥土作成的人偶，用某人的精神注入之后嵌以魔石制成的使魔。对主人的命令忠诚，有着不可阻挡的力量。\r\n即使是比常人更强的圣骑士的肉体，被它强壮的双手抓住后也很难挣脱，待其苦苦挣扎到无力后就会被送往主人所在的地方吧。如果即便这样手里的猎物还是不放弃继续抵抗的话……
The form taken by the goblin captain of the forest fortress after being empowered by the evil magic emitted from the black crystal ball. Highly intelligent for a goblin and a formerly loyal subject of Archlich, but deemed to be of no further use after luring Ricca to the fortress. \r\nHaving become part-undead through dark magic, he's bigger and stronger than a normal goblin, but weaker to flames. He possesses a powerful spinning attack, but if you make use of the chains hanging in the fortress, it should be easy to avoid.=在森林的城堡里驻扎的哥布林们的队长，用从黑色水晶球中释放的邪恶魔力强化之后的样子。在哥布林中智力卓越，是阿奎雷奇忠实的仆人，想着在Ricca被引到城堡里的时候埋伏她。\r\n被黑暗力量变成了半不死族，比一般的哥布林要强得多，但相应的对火焰的抗性变弱了。转圈攻击十分强力，利用好城堡内部悬挂着的锁链的话应该可以很容易规避掉。
An undead born from the fusion of a drain crystal's magic and human enmity. The spitting image of what humans regard to be a "grim reaper". Possesses no physical form since its body is composed of magic. \r\nA holy knight's weapon has the special ability to deal with enemies without losing its holy energy. Enemies hit by its blade will have their wounds filled with holy energy and take fatal damage, but because this monster doesn't possess a physical form, even a holy knight's weapon won't be able to deal any effective damage.=用人类的怨恨和导能水晶输送的魔力结合而成的不死族。它的样子就像人类想象中的「死神」一样，由于身体完全是由魔力构成的所以没有实体。\r\n圣骑士的武器有着直接传递神圣力量的属性。被攻击到的魔物会在伤口处被注入神圣的气息并受到致命伤害，对于无法直接伤害到的这个魔物即使是圣骑士的武器也无法有效对其造成伤害。
A female Demon who feeds on the semen of humans and demi-humans. In order to capture the holy knight girl, Miria's body was modified by Archlich's spells. She's been given a lightning attack that can pierce through holy protection as well as a magic eye that can seduce its target regardless of gender. Miria's sense of right and wrong have been overwritten to suit her monstrous form. With the desires she had kept hidden deep inside her amplified, the kind personality Miria used to have has been warped beyond recognition.=以人类和亚人的精液为食的女恶魔。阿奎雷奇用法术改造的Miria，为了能让她抓到圣骑士少女，阿奎雷奇还给予了她能贯穿神圣防御加护的雷电、不论异性还是同性都能魅惑的魔眼这两种特殊能力。精神上也染上了魔物的价值观，并且Miria内心深处沉睡的欲望也被强化了，过去善良的人格也被强行扭曲了。
A half-beast, half-Demon who possesses both a limitless supply of magic and an intellect high enough to understand human language. The beast that appeared in front of Ricca's party was one that had made a connection with a mage girl {{A}} years ago. From that experience, it began to hunt monsters and soon came to be worshipped as a guardian by humans in the surrounding lands. After its mind was polluted by evil energy, it began to shut itself away in its lair. It now protects the drain crystal that absorbs the overflowing earth magic from in the valley.=能听懂人话，拥有极高的智慧与魔法，储备着无尽魔力的半兽半魔物的生物。Ricca她们面前的这个个体，在６０年以前曾与魔法师少女心灵相通过，狩猎了周围的魔物，从而被周边地区的人类尊崇地称为「守护者」。受到邪恶的魔力后思想变得狂躁后盘踞在住处里，在山谷中吸收着大地的魔力并守护着导能水晶。
An undead that was revived when Archlich poured his magic energy into the corpse of an elite guard. Possesses intelligence on par with what it had before revival. Because it is controlled through magic rather than its own heavy muscles, the attacks its old bones makes are more precise than they were in life. \r\nDifficult to deal with because it wields a spear with a long reach, but if you can avoid the spear's tip, you may find an opportunity to strike. \r\nHaving lost its meat rod and means of release after becoming a skeleton, its pent-up desires have become deviously twisted.=阿奎雷奇用自己的魔力注入精锐士兵的尸体之后苏醒过来的不死族。拥有着活着时候的知性，代替原本强壮的肌肉的是用魔力驱动的骨骼，反而能使出比生前更加干净利落的战技。\r\n装备着盾牌和长枪，是非常麻烦的对手，击碎枪尖的话就能找到破绽了。\r\n因为变成白骨了自己的肉枪没有了不能导了，积攒的欲望扭曲成了阴湿。
A survivor of the giant beings once worshipped as gods of the sea. Having lost devotees due to the ascendancy of the sun god, it was driven from its home, and has since lived quietly in a cave at the bottom of the ocean. Despite gradually being forgotten, by performing good deeds such as freeing ships stuck in coral reefs in the nearby seas, it continued to try to live an existence beneficial to humans. However, after being exposed to the effects of evil magic, it turned into a monster and became Archlich's servant. Since becoming a monster, it has guarded the cave that leads to the castle. \r\nIn order to maintain its massive body, it uses an external magical core that it has taken into its body. This core was once given as an offering by believers, but...=过去被当作神一样敬仰的，曾掌管海洋的巨人族的残留。由于掌管太阳的神的实力上升，对它们的信仰消失后它们被赶到了海底的洞穴里静静地生活着。即使被遗忘了还是会帮助附近海域里触礁的船只，在人类中仍然是善良的存在。受到邪恶的魔力影响而变成了魔物，变成了阿奎雷奇的下仆。变成魔物之后在通往城里的道路的洞穴中守卫着。\r\n利用从外部获取的「魔力炉」来维持巨大的身体。那似乎是过去的信众们献上的东西……
A golem that was created using steel rather than soil and rocks. \r\nDespite possessing an impenetrable defense against fire, lightning, ice and the holy knight's weapon attacks, its magical core remains its weak point.=用钢铁材料代替泥土和岩石制成的魔像。\r\n它的身体被注入了炎、雷、冰的力量，用圣骑士的武器攻击是一样的，注入魔力的魔像的弱点并没有变。
A Demonic beast created by a lich by patching various parts of monsters and animals together. Possesses the ability to use its tentacle-shaped tail to stab and inject enemies that invade its territory with cursed, petrifying poison. \r\nThanks to holy energy, the holy knight possesses a high resistance to physical maladies. However, if enough petrifying poison to exceed said resistance were injected at once, there would be no stopping their body from turning to stone.=巫妖将动物和魔物的身体拼接之后做成的魔兽。对于侵入自己领地的生物会用触手状的尾巴突刺，并注入附有石化诅咒的毒液。\r\n圣骑士因为神圣之力的关系拥有着很高的异常状态抗性。然而如果被注入了大量的石化毒液的话，身体还是会因为抵抗力撑不住而被石化。
The leader of the arachne tribe that inhabits the northern lands. Because of a high magic affinity and therefore resistance, it isn't affected by the evil magic infecting the lands. However, to protect the northern lands for its comrades, it willingly became a subordinate of the Archlich. \r\nPossesses a large, powerful body which has adapted to better maintain its body heat in harsh environments. Despite having lost its ability to shoot webs, it can instead control ice magic to freeze and capture its prey.=在寒冷地带栖息着的阿拉库涅族的长老。拥有着很高的魔力和抵抗力，没有受到邪恶魔力的影响，但为了北地居住着的同族，自愿当了阿奎雷奇的部下。\r\n为了在严酷的环境中维持体温，大型化的身体很强韧，发射丝线的能力因此退化，但相应的拥有着操纵冰的魔法，可以利用冰魔法冻结并捕获猎物。
A ghoul created by a lich by pouring his evil magic into the corpse of an orc. With empowered endurance and regenerative abilities, any damage taken from a half-hearted attack will be instantly restored. Because its body size and weight have increased, each step it takes causes small tremors in its vicinity. It wields a war hammer infused with lightning magic, but unlike the succubus', this magic doesn't have any special properties.=巫妖给兽人的尸体注入邪恶魔力后产生的僵尸。耐久力和再生能力都得到了强化，受到半吊子的攻击会立马恢复。身体变大的同时体重也增加了，在地面上跺脚都会在周围引起地震。装备着附魔了雷电之力的铁锤，那雷是和魅魔的雷电不一样的没有特殊能力的雷。
A subspecies of wyvern born from a sudden mutation caused by waves that traveled through a gate from the world of darkness. \r\nIt can use magic to spew lava, but because its intelligence is so low, it will most likely hit both its prey and itself. The blood it sprays from its mouth contains a curse that decreases the defense of its target.=通过大门后由于黑暗世界的波动而引发突然变异产生的飞龙亚种。\r\n可以喷出熔岩、使用魔法，但由于智力很低会同时对猎物和自己造成伤害。可以从嘴里吐出血飞沫，附带有能降低对手防御力的诅咒。
Leader of the liches and the one responsible for placing the drain crystals across the lands. The principle force behind the monsters' increased aggressiveness. Dark energy consistently emanates from his body, and he can use a limitless amount of high level magic. \r\nDespite being a spellcaster, he is equipped with a sword and armor, allowing him to adequately engage in close combat as well.=死灵术士的首席，在各地设置导能水晶使得魔物凶暴化的幕后黑手。在它的身体里常有黑暗魔力涌出，可以使用无限的高级魔法。\r\n装备着与魔法师不相称的厚重甲胄和剑，看来即使是近战也没有什么问题。
The form taken by the court magician who was once in an illicit relationship with the queen of the island castle, after taking over and modifying the body of one of the queen's royal guards. \r\nHe planned to usurp the throne in an attempt to prove his worthiness to the woman he loved, but as far as the queen was concerned he was merely one of her many lovers. His ambitions grew beyond his stature, and after sullying his hands with illegal necromancy, he was soon reported to the authorities and dragged to the execution grounds. In the moment of his death, he completed a spell to steal the lives of all the residents on the island, and was reborn as an undead. He used monsters to rule the surrounding regions but was unable to obtain his revenge against the queen. \r\nIn order to fulfill his ambitions and find the queen, he continued to expand his territories before being eliminated by a female knight wielding the power of the sun.=与岛上城邦的王妃有着禁断关系的宫廷魔法师，夺取了王妃的近卫骑士的身体并进行改造之后的样子。\r\n男人为了让自己配得上心爱的女人，尽可能地夺取着王位，但是对于王妃来说，他就只是众多男人当中的一个，于是疏远了他。最终他因为自己的野心和接触了禁忌的死灵术被告发后被送往刑场。在被处死的时候，夺取岛内全部住民的死灵术完成，他也作为不死族复活了。他驱使魔物支配了周边地区但还是没有向王妃复仇成功。\r\n为了实现野心和搜索王妃继续扩大着领域，最后被使用太阳之力的女骑士成功讨伐。
The descendent of a primal dragon that the previous holy knight sealed away in another world. The injuries from its previous battle still haven't healed so there are open wounds covering its body. Despite possessing a large body and enormous magical power, its intelligence is lacking, which is why it only attempts to devour whatever lies before it. However, its gluttony knows no bounds, it is capable of eradicating all creatures inhabiting an entire continents within a few weeks. \r\nLong ago, the being known as "God" amongst humans and fairies used sunlight to banish the dragon tribe that lives in darkness from the land's surface. The power of the holy knight, which unleashes the same dazzling sunlight, is a power meant to seal away monsters just like this.=被前代圣骑士封印在异世界的原始的龙的末裔。上次战斗造成的伤口还没有愈合，身上还有着被撕开的伤口。与巨大的身体和庞大的魔力相比它的智力并没有那么发达，只想着将眼前的东西全部当作自己的食物吃掉。但是它的食欲没有尽头，只需数周就可以吃绝一个大陆的生物。\r\n在遥远的过去，被人类和妖精叫做『神明大人』的存在用阳光将住在暗中的龙之一族从地上赶走了。如果是有着与阳光同样光辉的圣骑士的力量的话，一定有能封印这个魔物的力量。
An illusion created in a dream by Archlich in order to take over Ricca's body. Archlich attempted to engrave a crippling weakness to sexual desire into Ricca's heart and exhaust her mentally, before stealing control of her body. The after-effects of battle that flare up nearly every night for Ricca are by and large due to Archlich's interference. Archlich had originally planned to steal Ricca's body, research the dredges of holy energy within it and use his findings to formulate a plan to deal with the next holy knight that appeared.=阿奎雷奇为了占据Ricca的身体而在梦中制造出的幻影。\r\n阿奎雷奇在战胜不了淫欲的弱小Ricca的心中通过复现来消耗Ricca的精神从而夺取肉体的主导权。每晚发作的战争后遗症也都是阿奎雷奇干涉放大的，计划在成功夺取Ricca的身体之后再研究残留的神圣之力，等到下一个圣骑士出现的时候就有对抗手段了。
