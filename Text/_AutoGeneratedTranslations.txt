————————回忆novel，兽人怀孕的新娘————————【开始】——————
A week passed since we were defeated by the orcs in the port town.=自从我们在港口城镇被兽人击败，一周过去了。
Another day passes as I get raped under a stormy night sky by the orcs that attacked Claret's house.=又过了一天，我在暴风雨的夜空下被袭击克莱尔家的兽人强奸。
Ngh, aaaaugh, nngh, ah... Please, no more...!=啊，啊，啊，啊。。。求你了，不要再。。。！
Orc=兽人
Oink, oink! You're getting what you deserve, you little brat!=哎呀，哎呀！你得到了你应得的，你这个小家伙！
I haven't slept much since the three orcs defeated me. They have been raping me ever since.=自从三个兽人打败我后，我就没怎么睡过觉。从那以后他们一直在强奸我。
But it isn't just the orcs that have raped me.=但强奸我的不只是兽人。
I was also assaulted by the goblins who attacked the town, as well as some random monsters that showed up a few days ago.=我还遭到了袭击城镇的哥布林的袭击，以及几天前出现的一些随机怪物。

Numerous creatures had their way with my body, and filled my mouth, womanhood, and butt with their semen.=无数的生物在我的身体里游荡，用它们的精液填满我的嘴巴、女人的身体和屁股。
Every inch of my body has been sprayed with seed. I'm completely sullied.=我身体的每一寸都撒下了种子。我完全被玷污了。
Ngheek... Aaaah, nooo! Aaaah...=Ngheek。。。啊，不！啊。。。
At first, I struggled and bit and fought to escape, but that was only until I found out that the monsters took the townspeople hostage.=起初，我挣扎着、咬着、挣扎着逃跑，但直到我发现怪物们把镇上的人当作人质。


Bwehehe! I didn't expect you to be such a slut.=B哦！我没想到你会这么荡妇。

I let the vile creatures violate me without resistance, and eventually, Iris' seal lifted and my curse reactivated.=我让这些卑鄙的生物毫无抵抗地侵犯了我，最终，艾里斯的封印被解除，我的诅咒再次被激活。

The crest on my tummy absorbed the monsters' semen and grew stronger.=我肚子上的鸡冠吸收了怪物的精液，变得更强壮了。

Ladder/Grab chains\r\nAscend ladder=梯子/抓斗链\n登梯
Then finally, the crest took the shape of a womb. It had taken its complete form, just like the demoness had said.=最后，冠冕变成了子宫的形状。正如恶魔们所说，它已经形成了完整的形式。


My womb was filled with so much seed, it felt like it was going to burst.=我的子宫里充满了太多的种子，感觉好像要破裂了。


The activated curse drained my body of so much strength, I became as weak as my untransformed self. In addition, even the smallest movement caused jolts of pleasure to run through my body. I was in no condition to fight monsters.=激活的诅咒耗尽了我身体的力量，我变得和未转化的自己一样虚弱。此外，哪怕是最微小的动作也会让我的身体感到一阵愉悦。我没有条件和怪物战斗。
Once he got a chance to examine my body, the lich saw right through the mechanisms of my crest. He placed his wand over the marking to transfer magic into it.=一旦他有机会检查我的身体，巫妖就看穿了我的纹章。他把魔杖放在记号上，把魔法传给记号。
I recall my succubus sister telling me how the magic of monsters can activate various curse effects from my crest.=我记得我的魅魔妹妹告诉我，怪物的魔力如何从我的盾徽激活各种诅咒效果。
After the orc defeated and captured me, I was taken away by a horde of monsters led by their lich commander.=在兽人打败并俘虏我之后，我被巫妖指挥官带领的一大群怪物带走了。
Bwehehe! I gotta thank Master Archlich's geezer underlings for their generosity! Not only did they hand you over to me, but they also made you weak and obedient!=B哦！我要感谢阿奇Ricca大师那些古怪的下属们的慷慨！他们不仅把你交给了我，还让你软弱顺从！
With the crest in its final form, it keeps my body in a state of constant arousal, many times more sensitive than it was before.=随着羽冠的最终成形，它让我的身体处于一种不断觉醒的状态，比以前敏感很多倍。

Bwehehehe, this is what you get, you little brat... Oh, I'm sorry. Should I call you Miss Holy Knight Ricca!?=这就是你得到的，你这个小家伙。。。哦，对不起。我应该叫你神圣骑士丽卡小姐吗！？
Nngh, aaah...! I won't let...a monster like you...!=嗯，啊。。。！我不会让。。。像你这样的怪物。。。！
My arms are bound together behind his muscular shoulders.=我的胳膊绑在他肌肉发达的肩膀后面。
My legs are wrapped around his hips like a pair of tongs, and the orc's hard thick fingers grip my butt.=我的双腿像钳子一样缠绕着他的臀部，兽人又硬又粗的手指抓住了我的屁股。
It would be natural to see a loving couple embrace each other like this...but the creature making love to me is no gentleman.=看到一对相爱的夫妇像这样互相拥抱是很自然的。。。但那个和我做爱的家伙可不是绅士。
Bweh heh heh! You're doing great, miss holy knight! Your pussy won't stop gobbling up my cock! You can't get enough of me, can ya!?=嘿嘿嘿！你做得很好，圣骑士小姐！你的猫咪不停地吃我的公鸡！你不能满足我，对吧！？
That's not... Nhaaa, aaaah...true... I don't...nngh...like your...=那不是。。。啊啊啊啊。。。符合事实的我不。。。嗯。。。就像你的。。。
But the orc was right.=但兽人是对的。
The endless days and nights of sex trained my vagina to joyfully take in the orc's giant rod.=无休止的日日夜夜的性爱训练我的阴道快乐地吸纳兽人的巨棒。
Every time it enters and pounds me, my body reacts against my will and tightens on the cock.=每次它进入我的身体，使我感到沉重，我的身体就会违背我的意愿，紧绷着公鸡。
My erogenous zones are already more sensitive than ever. On top of that, my womanhood squirms in pleasure just from getting filled.=我的性欲区域已经比以往更加敏感了。最重要的是，我的女人只是因为饱了肚子而在快乐中蠕动。
Oooink! You're a bad liar, Miss Ricca! It's clear as day that you're completely turned on!=哦！你真是个大骗子，Ricca小姐！很明显，你完全兴奋起来了！
I-I am not turned... Nnaaah, nngheeek... And quit calling me that... Aaaaaah! Nnnhek, nnnhaaaaaaaaa!=我…我还没变成。。。nnaah，nngheek。。。别再这么叫我了。。。啊啊！Nnnhek，nnnhaaaaaaaaaa！
As the rod moves in and out of me, sloppy wet sounds echo, and white sticky juice splashes onto the ground.=当钓竿在我身上来回移动时，湿滑的声音回荡，白色粘稠的果汁溅到地上。
Bweh heh heh... Ricca, I'm going to make you my slave wife! So what's wrong with your husband calling his slave by her name!?=嘿嘿。。。Ricca，我要让你做我的奴隶妻子！你丈夫叫他的奴隶的名字怎么了！？
testtest<sprite%3D"Emoji name%3D":smail:">=测试<sprite%3D"Emoji name%3D":smail:">

Nhaa, hhhe, heek, ngh, nnngh... I won't become, nha, aaah, haaaan, nngh...your...wife...! I won't...aaah!=哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈。。。我不会变成，嗯，啊，哈安，嗯。。。你的妻子我不会。。。啊！
A pure-white veil sits on my head.=我头上戴着一块洁白的面纱。
If only... Nngh! I didn't have this curse...I could easily...kill you and... Aaaaah...!=要是…就好了不！我没有这个诅咒。。。我很容易。。。杀了你然后。。。啊啊。。。！
The orc was referring to the undead necromancer liches. Judging by his name, Archlich must also be a lich.=兽人指的是亡灵巫师巫妖。从他的名字来看，阿奇Ricca肯定也是一个巫妖。
Eeeek, aaah, aaaah! Nngh, aaah...!=啊，啊，啊！嗯，啊。。。！
My feet are adorned with white pumps and my arms are covered with white gloves. A beautiful white wedding dress completes the picture.=我的脚上穿着白色的鞋，胳膊上戴着白色的手套。一件漂亮的白色婚纱完成了这张照片。
This must be a bride's dress the monster stole from an aristocrat's mansion. It was probably a couple's precious keepsake.=这一定是怪物从贵族宅邸偷来的新娘礼服。这可能是一对夫妇的珍贵纪念品。
Your plump body is perfect wife material! Let's make lots and lots of love together, honey! Bweh heh heh... Human females love it when a man tells them that, right!?=你丰满的身体是完美的妻子材料！让我们一起做很多很多很多的爱，亲爱的！嘿嘿。。。人类女性喜欢男人告诉她们这些，对吧！？
Nnhaaa, hyaaa, I don't want...your love! Nngh, aah! You killed...all those townspeople... Aaah, heeh, nngh... Haah, nnghaaaaa...!=Nnhaaa，hyaaa，我不想。。。你的爱！啊，啊！你杀了。。。所有那些镇上的人。。。啊，嘿，嗯。。。哈，nnghaaaa。。。！
Whether the orc's love confession is honest or not, it's true that he hasn't done anything to scar my body since I was captured.=不管兽人的爱情坦白是否诚实，自从我被捕后，他确实没有做过任何伤害我身体的事。
That's only if I exclude the rape, of course. If I wasn't a holy knight, I would have been torn to shreds by now...=当然，除非我排除强奸。如果我不是一个神圣的骑士，我现在就会被撕成碎片。。。
I won't ever... Aaah, haaa... Become...haaah, aah, your bride...nngh, eeek...!=我永远不会。。。啊哈。。。成为哈，哈，你的新娘。。。哎呀。。。！
Oink oink oink! You're so confident, Miss Bitch Knight! And to think you were pushing semen out of your ass and begging the goblins to rape you yesterday!=Oink Oink Oink！你太自信了，婊子骑士小姐！想想你昨天把精液从屁股里挤出来乞求哥布林强奸你！
Ngh, heeek, ooooooohhh... Hyaaa, nngheek... That was...because of the curse... Ah, aaaaaaaaaaah!=嘿嘿嘿嘿。。。嗨，恩盖克。。。那是。。。因为诅咒。。。啊，啊，啊！
My face turns red from recalling yesterday's humiliation.=想起昨天的耻辱，我的脸都红了。
I only did it because the townspeople were taken hostage, but it was still mortifying to say such crude things in front of countless goblins while they watched my gaping butthole.=我这么做只是因为镇上的人被扣为人质，但当无数哥布林看着我张大的屁股时，当着他们的面说这样粗鲁的话，仍然让人感到难堪。
""I'm Ricca the slutty bitch knight! Please watch this cur spray cum from her shit hole! Make her orgasm and shoot your seed at her pervert pussy!" Isn't that what you said? Oink!"=“我是淫荡的婊子骑士Ricca！请看着这个从她屁眼喷出来的尿！让她达到高潮，向她变态的阴部射出你的种子！“你不是这么说的吗？哎呀！”
Nghhhhh, ngh, aaah, nnnnnnngh, aaaaaaaaah! Don't...! Nhaaaah, say that...! Ah, aaah...!=呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜！不要。。。！啊，说。。。！啊，啊。。。！
When the necromancer became the ruler of the port town, he praised the orc for capturing the holy knight. His reward was me.=当亡灵巫师成为港口城镇的统治者时，他称赞兽人捕获了神圣骑士。他的奖赏是我。
According to the lich, the Crest of Lust is so powerful, even those with divine protection lose their sanity to its influence.=根据巫妖的说法，欲望的顶峰是如此强大，即使是那些拥有神圣保护的人也会因为它的影响而失去理智。
However, three days have passed since the crest took its complete form, and my mind is still intact. I have yet to submit and become the orc's slave wife.=然而，三天过去了，我的心仍然完好无损。我还没有屈服，成为兽人的奴隶妻子。
Eeek, hyaa, aah, eeek, nnngh... Haah, haaah... I won't give in...=哎呀，哎呀，哎呀，哎呀。。。哈哈哈。。。我不会屈服。。。
After the monsters seized the town, all the soldiers were killed, and the young women were taken away somewhere.=在怪物占领了城镇之后，所有的士兵都被杀了，年轻的女性被带到了某个地方。
Those left in the town are tortured and forced to work as slaves for the vile creatures.=留在镇上的人受到折磨，被迫为这些卑鄙的生物充当奴隶。
The town is in ruins, but the least I can do is give hope to the captured humans by holding on. If I show them that the holy knight is strong enough to resist the monsters, I can give them the will to keep living.=这座城镇已经成了废墟，但我能做的至少是通过坚持给被俘的人类带来希望。如果我向他们展示神圣骑士的力量足以抵抗怪物，我可以给他们继续生存的意志。
With this determination, I have been able to endure all the humiliation the monsters have inflicted on me so far.=有了这个决心，我能够忍受怪物迄今为止给我带来的所有羞辱。
If only I didn't have the curse... I would have already killed you...and saved the town... Nngh...=要是我没有诅咒就好了。。。我早就杀了你了。。。拯救了这个小镇。。。嗯。。。
Iris said that God's brooch doesn't just make my body stronger, it also makes my spirit stronger.=艾里斯说上帝的胸针不仅让我的身体更强壮，还让我的精神更坚强。
It must have given my heart the strength to endure all this humiliation I've been subjected to.=它一定给了我的心力量去忍受我所遭受的一切屈辱。
Bwehehe! I know you're feeling it, so just give up! The lich geezer said I can have you if I make you surrender.=B哦！我知道你感觉到了，所以放弃吧！巫妖怪说，如果我让你投降，我可以得到你。
Eeek, aaah... I will...never give up... Iris...and Claret...went to call for help... Hyaa, aah, ha, eek, haaaah...!=哎呀。。。我会的。。。永不放弃。。。艾瑞丝。。。还有红葡萄酒。。。去呼救了。。。哈哈哈…哈哈哈。。。！
While I distracted the monsters, I had Iris and Claret sneak out of the port town so they could call for reinforcements.=当我分散了怪物们的注意力时，我让艾里斯和克莱尔偷偷溜出港口小镇，以便他们能呼叫增援部队。
Claret's parents work for the army of the royal capital, so if she uses her connections to tell a higher-up about this town's situation, they can save me and the townspeople.=克莱尔的父母在皇家首都的军队工作，所以如果她利用自己的关系向上级报告这个城镇的情况，他们可以拯救我和镇上的人。
That's why I have to hang in there until they come. The townspeople may have become slaves, but I have to continue acting as their beacon of light.=这就是为什么我必须坚持到他们来。镇上的人可能已经成为奴隶，但我必须继续充当他们的灯塔。
I know that magic marking makes you really sensitive! Bweheheh, come on. Tell me that you want me to fuck your pussy!=我知道魔法标记让你很敏感！别这样。告诉我你想让我操你的猫咪！
*Shlop, shlop, shlop...!*=*嘘，嘘，嘘*
The orc's hips push and pull farther, and his movements speed up.=兽人的臀部推拉得更远，他的动作也加快了。
I desperately clench my teeth to endure the sensation building in my vagina.=我拼命咬紧牙关，忍受阴道里的感觉。
Aah, haa, nnheek, aaah, hyaan... I won't...ever... Say that...again...!=啊，哈，恩希克，啊，海安。。。我不会。。。曾经说。。。再一次
When the monsters make me recite their obscene phrases, it's always in front of the townspeople.=当怪物们让我背诵他们淫秽的话语时，总是在镇上的人们面前。
The villagers avert their eyes, knowing that I'm only being forced to stay such crude things. Still, it's mortifying to have them see me like this.=村民们转移了视线，知道我只是被迫呆在这种粗鲁的地方。尽管如此，让他们看到我这样还是很丢脸。
What's worse, saying lewd things brings back memories of when I was tormented by the goblins in the fortress. It causes my body to burn with pleasure.=更糟糕的是，说猥亵的话让我回想起我在堡垒里被哥布林折磨的情景。它使我的身体愉快地燃烧。
Haaaah, nngh, eek, nooo... Stop, aaah...=哈哈，不，不，不。。。停下，啊。。。
The orc continues to pound my vagina with his large manhood.=兽人继续用他高大的男子气概敲打我的阴道。
Hard, wet sounds erupt from my hole. I can feel gushes of juice flowing from me each time he enters me.=坚硬潮湿的声音从我的洞里爆发出来。每次他走进我，我都能感觉到我身上涌出的汁液。
Aaaaaah, aaaaah, sto...p...! Nnngh, aaah, aaaan, nnnngh, aaaah!=aaaaaaaaaaaaah，sto。。。P啊，啊，啊，啊，啊！
Unlike my consciousness, my cursed body happily indulges in the pleasures of the thrusting rod. I can't help but moan from the sensation.=与我的意识不同，我被诅咒的身体快乐地沉迷于插杆的乐趣。这种感觉让我忍不住呻吟起来。
Hyaaah... I won't give in... Ah, aah, I'll never...give in...=哈哈。。。我不会屈服。。。啊，啊，我永远不会。。。屈服
Huff, huff... Oink...! Ricca! Stop acting so tough! It's useless!=哈夫，哈夫。。。哎呀。。。！Ricca！别那么强硬了！没用！
The orc breathes hard from fatigue, pushes his hips far into me, and stops his movement.=兽人因疲劳而呼吸困难，将臀部推到我身上，并停止运动。
Nhaaah, haaah... Haaaah... Nnhaaa... Haaa...=哈哈哈。。。哈哈。。。Nnhaaa。。。哈。。。
Bweeeh... Bweeeh... You're putting up a good fight today...=Bweeeh。。。Bweeeh。。。你今天打得很好。。。
Oink...Then I'll make you give up...with this...!=Oink。。。那我就让你放弃。。。用这个。。。！
Haaaaah, eeek...!=哈哈，嘿。。。！
Suddenly, the orc pulls his hips back.=突然，兽人将臀部向后拉。
At the same time, the grip on my butt lifts me up so high, the giant penis almost slips out of my vagina.=与此同时，紧握着我的屁股把我抬得很高，巨大的阴茎几乎从我的阴道里滑了出来。
With a wet slap, the thrusting rod pushes out the juices that fill my privates.=用一记湿耳光，插杆推出充满我私处的汁液。
Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaann!=哈哈！aaaaaaaaann！
I feel an intense rush of pleasure from the head of the penis scraping against my inner walls. A loud, crude moan leaks out of my mouth.=我感觉到一股强烈的快感从阴茎的头部掠过我的内壁。一声粗野的呻吟从我嘴里漏了出来。
The orc's hand squeezes my butt so hard, his fingers dig into my flesh.=兽人的手使劲捏着我的屁股，他的手指戳进了我的肉。
I already know what he's going to do next.=我已经知道他下一步要做什么了。
He has forced me to cum with this technique many times before.=他以前多次强迫我使用这种技巧。
Eeek... No, anything but that! Stoooooop...!=哎呀。。。不，除了那个！嘘。。。！
The orc pulls down my butt with his tight grip and thrusts his hips vigorously.=兽人紧紧地抓住我的屁股，使劲地插入臀部。
Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!=哈哈哈哈！
The orc shoves his giant penis into me with twice the speed with which he pulled it out.=兽人用两倍于他拔出的速度把他的巨大阴茎塞进我体内。
A vulgar, fart-like sound comes out from my hole. It's so loud, it seems like the whole square must have heard it.=从我的洞里传出一种粗俗的、像屁一样的声音。声音太大了，好像整个广场都听到了。
The tip of the orc penis passes through my private path in no time and pushes up against my womb entrance.=兽人阴茎的尖端很快就穿过我的私人通道，推到我的子宫入口。
Oooooooh! Ooh, ooooh.. Nnghoooooooooooooooooooh!=哦哦！哦，哦。。NNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO！
My body squeezes out an unladylike groan from the pit of my stomach.=我的身体从胃窝里挤出一声不淑女般的呻吟。
The head pierces through my uterus' small hole to enter deep inside me.=头穿过我子宫的小孔进入我的内心深处。
(<indent%3D0.4em>He's spreading my womb entrance open... That's where...Miria injected the poison...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>他正在打开我的子宫入口。。。那就是。。。米里亚注射了毒药……）
Aaaaaaaah! I'm cumming! I'm cumming! I'm cummiiiiiiiiiiing! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!=啊啊！我要高潮了! 我要高潮了! 我是卡米林！啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！
My body pulses over and over.=我的身体一次又一次地跳动。
Because of the succubus' poison, my womb feels pleasure from every bit of stimulation inflicted upon it. Not only that, the curse engraved beyond its entrance makes it even more sensitive.=因为魅魔的毒药，我的子宫从每一点刺激中都能感受到快乐。不仅如此，它入口处刻着的诅咒让它更加敏感。
There is no way I can endure the orc's giant rod when my genitalia is in such condition.=当我的生殖器处于这种状态时，我无法忍受兽人的巨大棍子。
Nhhheeeeeeeeeeeeek, haaaaaaaaaaahhh... Aaaaaaah...=哈哈哈哈哈哈。。。啊啊啊。。。
Oink! I've already learned that slamming into this spot instantly turns you into a slutpig! Give up already and beg for me like before!=哎呀！我已经了解到，猛撞到这个地方会立刻让你变成一个荡妇！放弃吧，像以前一样求我吧！
The orc's strong grip keeps my hips in midair. He continues to roll his hips back and forth.=兽人强大的抓地力让我的臀部保持在半空中。他继续前后翻滚臀部。
Aaaaah, aaaah, no! Don't move like that! Not there! Aaaah, you're too deep! Aaah, nngheeek, nooooo!=啊，啊，不！别那样动！不在那里！啊，你太深了！啊啊，不，不！
Our genitalia collide. A sloppy sound erupts every time they rub against each other.=我们的生殖器相撞。他们每次摩擦都会发出一种马虎的声音。
The orc moves his hips persistently to enjoy the sensation of my inner walls stroking his large penis-head.=兽人不断地移动他的臀部，享受我的内壁抚摸他的大阴茎头的感觉。
Bwehehe! Come on, say it! Beg for me to fuck your pussy more!=B哦！来吧，说出来！求我多操你的阴部！
Nghaaa, I won't! Aaaah, nooo, I won't... Aaah, stoooop! Not so deep! I can't take it! Don't screw it in like thaaaaaat!=Nghaaa，我不会的！啊，不，我不会。。。啊，嘘！没那么深！我受不了！别把它拧成这样！
Due to the crest, even the inside of my womb had become a sensitive erogenous zone.=由于有了鸡冠，甚至我的子宫内部也变成了一个敏感的性敏感区。
With every scrape at my uterus, an intense pleasure swells in the depths of my tummy.=每次刮我的子宫，一种强烈的快感就会在我的肚子深处涌起。
Overwhelmed, I spontaneously cling to the orc with my restrained arms.=我不知所措，用我克制的手臂自发地抓住了兽人。
Aaaaah... Aaaah, aaagh!=啊啊。。。啊，啊！
Oink! You're gonna make me blush if you embrace me so passionately!=哎呀！如果你如此热情地拥抱我，我会脸红的！

The orc doesn't have a hostage this time, so there's no reason for me to beg. I would never beg for him.=兽人这次没有人质，所以我没有理由乞求。我永远不会乞求他。
Port Town Man A=港口城市男人A
The holy knight... She's scarifying herself for us...=神圣骑士。。。她在为我们吓唬自己。。。
Port Town Man B=港口城市男子B
She's getting raped by that orc again...?=她又被那个兽人强奸了。。。？
Kheck! Stay focused, slave!=凯克！集中注意力，奴隶！
Besides, there are people around me right now. They can see me while they work to make this town into the monsters' new fortress.=此外，现在我周围还有人。当他们努力把这个城镇变成怪物的新堡垒时，他们可以看到我。
Tsk... Oink, so you still won't say it, huh...=Tsk。。。Oink，所以你还是不说，嗯。。。

Haaah... Haaah... Nngheeeeeeeek!=哈。。。哈。。。nngheeeeek！
With a big, sloppy slip, the penis slides out of my womb.=随着一个又大又乱的滑落，阴茎滑出了我的子宫。
The penis head spreads the entrance wide apart, and another yelp spills from my mouth.=阴茎头将入口分开，另一声尖叫从我嘴里溢出。
Bwehehe, the lich geezer told me something good! Your womb can only bear the children of monsters now, right!?=哦，巫妖怪告诉我一些好消息！你的子宫现在只能生怪物的孩子，对吧！？
The Crest of Lust that the demoness engraved into me is a curse designed to turn human women into child-birthing slaves.=恶魔刻在我身上的欲望之巅是一种诅咒，旨在将人类女性变成生育奴隶。
When the crest absorbed semen and took its complete form, it changed the shape of my uterus. Now, my body can only birth the offspring of monsters.=当鸡冠吸收精液并形成完整的形状时，它改变了我子宫的形状。现在，我的身体只能生下怪物的后代。

Bweheheh, I can't say I hate your bullish attitude... Looks like I gotta use this thing, eh?=我不能说我讨厌你的乐观态度。。。看来我得用这个东西了？
The orc takes out a black gem from his loincloth and flashes it at me.=兽人从他的腰带中拿出一块黑色宝石，朝我闪了闪。
Haaah, haaah... That's...a magic crystal... No, stop...!=哈哈哈。。。那是。。。一块神奇的水晶。。。不，停。。。！
Chills run down my back.=我背上发冷。
That gem... Isn't that...?=那个宝石。。。那不是。。。？

He presses the black gem firmly on the crest engraved into my lower abdomen.=他把黑色的宝石牢牢地按在刻在我小腹上的纹章上。
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!=哈哈！
The gem burns hot and emits a dark-purple light. It is the same color as the magic that enlarged the goblin captain I fought at the forest fortress.=宝石灼热，发出深紫色光芒。它的颜色和我在森林堡垒战斗的哥布林队长的魔法一样。
The heat spreads from the gem to inside my tummy, eventually setting my whole body on fire with burning lust.=热量从宝石扩散到我的肚子里，最终点燃了我全身燃烧的欲望。
Aaaaah, ghaaah! My body... Nghaaaaaaa!=啊啊，啊啊！我的身体。。。Nghaaaaaa！
My vagina holds part of the penis and endlessly overflows with juice.=我的阴道容纳着阴茎的一部分，不断地充满汁液。
I'm even splashing pee from my urethra. My privates are soaking wet.=我甚至把尿从尿道溅出来。我的私处湿透了。
Aaaaaaah, no, nghaaaaaaaa...!=啊啊啊，不，啊啊啊啊。。。！
I remember the succubus happily explaining to me that the heat in my tummy is a sign that I am ovulating.=我记得那个魅魔高兴地向我解释说，我肚子里的热量是我排卵的标志。
An egg has been released into my womb, and I am ready to carry the child of a monster.=一个卵子已经被释放到我的子宫里，我已经准备好抱一个怪物的孩子了。
Aaaaaah, hyaaaaaaannn... Nnngh... Haaah... Haaah... Aaaaagh...=啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊。。。嗯。。。哈。。。哈。。。啊啊啊。。。
By now, a light breeze is enough to strain my breathing and make me moan.=现在，微风已经足够让我喘不过气来，让我呻吟。
Bwehehe! And that's all it takes to get you pregnant! You have such a convenient body, Miss Holy Knight!=B哦！这就是让你怀孕所需要的一切！你的身体真舒服，圣骑士小姐！
*Shlp... Shlp, shlp, shlbbbb!*=*嘘。。。嘘，嘘，嘘*
The orc throws the gem to the ground once it loses its glow. He inserts his penis into me and resumes his violent thrusts.=一旦宝石失去光泽，兽人就会把它扔到地上。他把阴茎插入我体内，继续猛烈地插入。
Aaaah! E-eek, nngh, aaah! Noooo...! I can't... Nhagh, eek... Nooo... I don't want a monster baby...! Nooo! Nhaaah!=啊！哎呀，哎呀！不。。。！我不能。。。嗯，嗯。。。不。。。我不想要怪物宝宝。。。！不！啊！
I want to push this monster away from me as soon as I can, yet I keep moaning sweetly.=我想尽快把这个怪物推离我，但我一直在甜蜜地呻吟。
The orc's heavy chest presses against my breast. The way it rubs against my nipples feels good.=兽人沉重的胸膛压在我的胸膛上。它摩擦我乳头的感觉很好。
I can't even say I hate how he squeezes my butt anymore.=我甚至不能说我讨厌他再捏我的屁股了。
Bweh he he! This is what you get for killing my bro! I'm gonna cum in you lots so you can bear tons of kids!=呵呵呵呵！这就是你杀了我兄弟所得到的！我要给你们加很多，这样你们就可以生很多孩子了！

Aaaaah... Please... Please don't impregnate me with any more of your babies... Pleeeeease!=啊啊。。。请请不要再让我怀上你的孩子了。。。拜托！

The next time he fertilizes my egg, I might go insane with pleasure before the fear gets to me.=下次他让我的卵子受精时，我可能会在恐惧降临之前高兴得发疯。

At this point, I've forgotten that I was God's holy knight... That I had killed so many monsters. That it was only natural that they despised me.=在这一点上，我忘记了我是上帝的神圣骑士。。。我杀了那么多怪物。他们鄙视我是很自然的。
In my mind, I'm just a tortured village girl. I did nothing to deserve getting raped and killed by this monster. I blame my dead sister and this cruel word for my awful fate.=在我看来，我只是一个饱受折磨的乡村女孩。我没有做任何值得被这个怪物强奸和杀害的事。我把我可怕的命运归咎于我死去的妹妹和这个残酷的字眼。

Skeleton Warrior B=骷髅战士B
You still feel shame even after being raped by goblins in the town square for three days and nights? No... Since you're a slut, you must be pretending to be embarrassed to try to seduce us.=即使在城市广场被妖精强奸了三天三夜，你仍然感到羞耻吗？不既然你是个荡妇，那你一定是在假装很难为情来引诱我们。

The townspeople are an important labor force for us in renovating this port that's to be our stronghold. We're treating them as such.=镇民是我们改造这个港口的重要劳动力，这个港口将是我们的据点。我们是这样对待他们的。
To think a girl like you is the knight of God who has killed so many of my companions... Even though we defeated them, the townspeople seem to trust in your abilities and are looking for a chance to rebel.=想到像你这样的女孩是上帝的骑士，他杀了我那么多的同伴。。。即使我们打败了他们，镇上的人似乎相信你的能力，正在寻找反抗的机会。

And if we kill you, the townspeople may launch a violent revolt.=如果我们杀了你，镇上的人可能会发动暴力反抗。

S-So...please... She was taken away by monsters... She needs me... She's probably...being tortured right now... That's why... Ah...=S-So。。。请她被怪物带走了。。。她需要我。。。她可能。。。现在被折磨。。。这就是为什么。。。啊。。。
Wait, you went into the mountains to save your kidnapped sister, right? But then you got beaten up by the monsters instead.=等等，你去山里救你被绑架的妹妹，对吗？但是你却被怪物打败了。
How tragic... You're such a brave little girl.=多么悲惨。。。你真是个勇敢的小女孩。
Nnn, uh... Y-Yes... Ha... Th-Thank you...=嗯。。。是的。。。哈谢谢你。。。

Ugh, this is so boring. I came loads in her and still no reaction.=这太无聊了。我在她身上穿了很多衣服，但还是没有反应。
She's been like this for about a month. We don't have any more money, either. Maybe we should blow this hideout.=她这样已经有一个月了。我们也没有更多的钱了。也许我们应该炸掉这个藏身处。
Yeah, sounds good. The quarries and mines are infested with monsters now, and the port town is wrecked, too. There's nowhere left around here to make any money.=听起来不错。采石场和矿山现在到处都是怪物，港口城镇也被摧毁了。这附近没有地方可以赚钱了。
Aaah, look... My tummy... It's round like a baby tomato... A baby... Aha...=啊，看。。。我的肚子。。。它像一个小番茄一样圆。。。一个婴儿。。。啊哈。。。
Fuck it, fine... Let's go look for a new cash grab opportunity. Heheh, I wish another fairy would come flying by. We could make a quick buck selling it off.=去他妈的，好吧。。。让我们去寻找一个新的抢钱机会。嘿嘿，我希望另一个仙女能飞过。我们可以很快把它卖掉。

——————第六章————————
The settlement that was attacked by monsters a while ago should be in this forest...=在这片森林里应该有不久前被魔物袭击过的村落……
It's still daytime, but it's quite dark here... Could there be a Drain Crystal around here too?=明明是白天，还这么暗……这里也有黑暗水晶吗？
If the people here could tell us where the monsters live, it could be a clue... I hope Miria is safe...=如果这里的人能告诉我们怪物住在哪里，这可能是一个线索。。。我希望Miria是安全的。。。
Have you noticed how sometimes monsters will go spinning away when you attack them?=你有没有注意到，当你攻击魔物的时候，有时会把它们击飞吧？
Yeah. It's amazing how easily the holy knight weapon can blow them away.=是 啊神奇的是，圣骑士的武器能轻而易举地将他们击退。
If the monster blown away hits another monster and defeats them as well, their magic will fuse together and they'll drop double the Magic Stones.=如果让击飞的魔物撞向别的魔物并击败他们，魔物之间的魔力融合将掉落双倍的魔法石。
Wow, really?=哇，真的吗？
You can use the same trick with the rocks that goblins throw, too. If you hit it back at the goblin, they'll drop more Magic Stones. It's a little tricky, but you should try it out when you can afford to.=你也可以对哥布林扔的石头使用同样的技巧。如果你回击哥布林，他们会扔下更多的魔法石。这有点棘手，但你应该在负担得起的时候尝试一下。
Hell Beetle=地狱甲虫
Goblin=哥布林

I think you can push and pull this big box in your holy knight form.=这个大箱子，如果你变身成圣骑士的话，我想是可以推得动的
Investigate=侦查
If you stand to either side of a wooden box you find on the ground,\r\nyou can push or pull it in either direction.=如果你站在地上找到的一个木箱的任一侧，\n你可以向任何方向推或拉它。
Oh, I can? But it looks so heavy...=啊？是吗？明明很重的样子……
You have a lot more muscle and endurance while you're transformed. That's why you're able to fight monsters with such a big weapon.=变成圣骑士的时候，身体的力量和耐力会被强化。这就是为什么你能用这么大的武器对付怪物。
I wonder what Miria would say if she saw me wielding this thing and fighting monsters...=我想知道如果姐姐看到我挥舞着这个东西和怪物搏斗会怎么说。。。



This place... It must be the goblins' campsite.=这个地方。。。那一定是哥布林们的营地。


You mean, this is where the monsters live!? Iris, do you sense Miria... Do you sense anyone?=你是说，这就是怪物生活的地方！？Iris，你感觉到Miria。。。你感觉到有人吗？
I don't. I can't feel any human presence here.=我没有，我感觉不到这里有人。
This campsite is pretty small, when I think about the number of monsters that attacked your village.=这个营地和袭击你们村庄的哥布林的数量相比，规模太小了。
I see... Alright, then. Let's keep moving and find the settlement.=我懂了。。。那好吧。让我们继续前进，找到解决方案。


This is the forest settlement...? H-Hey, Iris... Do you sense anyone...?=这是森林定居点。。。？嗨，Iris。。。你感觉到有人。。。？

No, it's just as it looks... I can't sense any human life.=不，只是看起来。。。我感觉不到任何人的生命。
Judging by these burnt remains...the settlement must have been destroyed recently. It's been completely burnt to the ground.=从这些烧焦的遗骸来看。。。定居点最近一定被摧毁了。它完全被烧成了灰烬。
So there's no one here...? But we needed people to tell us where the monsters dwell...=所以这里没有人。。。？但我们需要有人告诉我们怪物住在哪里。。。
This isn't anything like what I was told...! I heard that this settlement wasn't hurt too badly from the monster attacks, but it's completely ruined... Did we come here for nothing...!?=这和我被告知的完全不同。。。！我听说这个营地没有受到怪物的严重袭击，但它已经完全被摧毁了。。。我们来这里是白来的吗。。。！？
Calm down. I feel the wicked presence of a Drain Crystal from this direction. If the monsters who attacked your village were Archlich's henchmen, we might find clues near the Crystal.=冷静。我感觉到这个方向有一个邪恶的黑暗水晶。如果攻击你村庄的怪物是Archlich的心腹，我们可能会在水晶附近找到线索。
A Drain Crystal... Okay, let's head over there.=黑暗水晶。。。好的，我们去那边吧。
Anyway...=无论如何
What's with that...big blue doll sitting over there...?=这是怎么回事。。。坐在那边的蓝色大娃娃。。。？
That's the rotten corpse of a human.=那是一具腐烂的人类尸体。
H-Human...!? Ro-Rotten...corpse...!? Oh no... Ugh...=人类。。。！？人的……尸体！？什么……啊…啊………

Is it that unusual? It must have been a human who lived in this settlement. There's still flesh on it, so this place must have been attacked not too long ago.=有那么不寻常吗？一定是住在这个定居点的人。上面还有血肉，所以这个地方一定是不久前被袭击的。


Eeek! Th-The corpse... I-It's moving...=哎呀！尸体。。。它在移动。。。

That's a ghoul. The magic from the Drain Crystal turned the human's corpse into an undead monster.=那是个食尸鬼。黑暗水晶的魔法将人类的尸体变成了不死怪物。
The Drain Crystal did that? It made the dead person into a monster...?=是黑暗水晶造成的吗？它把死人变成了怪物。。。？
Those things regenerate their rotten bodies as they move around, so they'll easily recover if your attacks aren't strong enough.=这些东西在移动时会再生腐烂的身体，所以如果你的攻击不够强大，它们很容易恢复。
You'll need to strike a powerful blow if you want to defeat them.=如果你想打败他们，你就需要做出有力的打击。
A female...ghost...!?=一个女。。。鬼!?
Those ghosts are called wraiths. They're monsters made when evil magic accumulates around vengeful human spirits.=那些鬼魂被称为wraiths。它们是邪恶魔法聚集在复仇的人类灵魂周围时制造的怪物。
Wraith=幽灵
You can't hit them while they're in their ghost form, and they attack by blowing a cold breath that can freeze your soul. You'd better be careful.=当他们处于鬼魂形态时，你不能打他们，他们会通过吹一口冷气来攻击你，这会让你的灵魂冻结。你最好小心点。


I was hoping that...we could find the monsters' base if we asked the people in the settlement...=我希望。。。如果我们询问营地里的人，我们就能找到怪物的基地。。。
But not only did those people lose their home and lives...they've been turned into monsters after death! I'm going to crush the cruel monsters who did that to them!=但是这些人不仅失去了家园和生命...他们死后变成了怪物！我要粉碎那些对他们做出这种事的残忍的怪物！
Ghehe! It's a human! A human woman! A young female!=嘿嘿！是人类！人类女人！一个年轻的女人！
Huh!?=呵呵！？
I guess you escaped from our killing spree... Kheck!? You must be the woman our shitty captain was looking for!=我猜你从我们的疯狂杀戮中逃脱了。。。凯克！？你一定就是我们那该死的队长要找的女人！
Killing spree...? D-Did you kill the settlement people!?=疯狂杀人。。。？你杀了定居点的人吗！？
Khehe, what a plump, sexy body... You look weak, too! You came here alone to get raped, didn't ya!? Khehehe, you nasty perverted slut!=桀桀，多么丰满性感的身体。。。你看起来也很虚弱！你是一个人来这里被强奸的，是吗！？桀桀，你这可恶的变态荡妇！
Wha...!?=什么。。。！？
I-I am not...! I'm not a n-nasty perverted slut!=我不是。。。！我不是讨厌的变态荡妇！
How vulgar... Don't waste your energy worrying about what a dumb goblin says.=多么粗俗。。。不要浪费精力去担心一个愚蠢的哥布林会说什么。
B-But...=但是。。。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Ugh... But you got mad when that goblin back at the village mocked you, Iris...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呃。。。但是当村子里的那个哥布林嘲笑你时，你生气了，Iris……）
B-But he's saying really disgraceful things to me... And I can't let him get away with destroying the settlement...=但他对我说了一些很不光彩的话。。。我不能让他破坏定居点而逍遥法外。。。
Huh!? The goblin ran off...!?=呵呵！？哥布林跑了。。。！？
He didn't run in the direction of the campsite we found earlier. I feel evil magic ahead, so it might be a large monster encampment... Let's give him what he wants and follow him.=他没有朝我们之前找到的营地方向跑。我感觉前方有邪恶的魔法，所以这可能是一个巨大的怪物营地。。。让我们给他想要的，跟着他。
Yeah, he might lead us to Miria...!=是的，他可能会带我们找到Miria。。。！
That must be...the new holy knight... Is she from that village...?=那一定是。。。新的神圣骑士。。。她是那个村子的人吗。。。？
I finally awaken from my long slumber, and that little girl is who you send to face me...? God of Sunlight...you underestimate my power...=我终于从沉睡中醒来，那个小女孩就是你派来面对我的人。。。？太阳之神。。。你低估了我的力量。。。
However, I cannot take any risks... That girl's body will be mine...=然而，我不能冒任何风险。。。那个女孩的身体将是我的。。。
Hahahaha... I see... So she's this woman's sister... I cannot blame the ignorant goblins for mistaking you for her...=哈哈哈。。。我懂了。。。所以她是这个女人的妹妹。。。我不能责怪无知的哥布林把你错当成了她。。。
What...? You want to take her place? Hah, the devotion, the self-sacrifice... Your will is just as beautiful as your looks. You're nothing like that whore who deceived me.=什么？你想代替她吗？哈，奉献，自我牺牲。。。你的意志和外表一样美丽。你可不像那个骗我的婊子。
That being the case...=既然如此。。。
Still, you're only a woman... By nature, a lowly beast that indulges in shallow pleasures.=尽管如此，你还是一个女人。。。天生是一只沉溺于浅薄享乐的卑微野兽。
I want you to use your sisterly love to bring out the lustful female that dwells in that girl's body...and gift me with a new whore!=我想你用你的姐妹之爱来激发那个女孩体内的女性欲望。。。然后给我一个新的妓女！
Khekeke! Fool! Idiot! Bumpkin!=桀桀！蠢人蠢人乡巴佬！

Eeek! Oww... This place is a wreck...=哎呀！哦。。。这地方一片废墟。。。
What do you expect when you break things without thinking? You should learn to be more careful.=当你不假思索地破坏事物时，你期待什么？你应该学会更加小心。
I just thought there would be Magic Stones inside...=我以为里面会有魔法石。。。
Is this a trap the goblins set? I don't think it hurt you that much. What a stupid trick.=这是哥布林设下的陷阱吗？我不认为这会能对你造成多大伤害。多么愚蠢的把戏啊。
Eeek! Don't just talk about it! Help me!=哎呀！别只是说说而已！帮助我！
It's too sturdy for me to break it. It'll stop eventually. Just wait it out.=它太结实了，我打不破。它最终会停止的。等等。
I'm so embarrassed. I can't believe I got caught in a trap like that... Do you think there are other traps like that here?=我很尴尬。我不敢相信我被这样的陷阱困住了。。。你觉得这里还有其他类似的陷阱吗？
We're talking about goblins here, so I'm sure there are. You should be able to spot traps if you look closely. Watch out and don't get caught in one again.=我们说的是这里的哥布林，所以我肯定这里还会有。如果你仔细观察，你应该能够发现陷阱。小心，别再被夹在里面了。

Iris detects the life force of a human at the goblin fortress.\r\nIn order to reunite with Miria, Ricca makes her way into the fortress where goblins lie in wait.=Iris感应到来自哥布林要塞的一个人类的生命力。\r\n为了和Miria重聚，Ricca进入了有哥布林埋伏的要塞。

It's very faint...but I feel the presence of human life around this tower. Looks like we were right to follow that goblin.=非常微弱。。。但我感觉到这座塔周围有人类的存在。看来我们跟踪那个哥布林是对的。

You got it!=明白了！
Alright... Let's go inside the fortress!=好吧，我们到堡垒里去！
There are goblin wizards here too.=这里也有哥布林巫师。
Their magic lets them attack from far away, and once they activate their magic circles, it can't be stopped.=他们的魔法可以让他们从远处攻击，一旦他们激活了他们的魔法圈，就无法阻止。
But it takes them a moment to activate their magic, so they're defenseless while they wait. That's your time to attack.=但是他们需要一段时间来激活他们的魔法，所以他们在等待时毫无防备。现在是你进攻的时候了。

She says she doesn't care, but I think she'll let me go now.=她说她不在乎，但我想她现在会放我走的。
Miri...a...=米莉。。。A.

Why...? I apologized properly...!=为什么？我正确地道歉了。。。！
The needle tail presses against the skin on my lower abdomen once again. It begins to carve the spell with its magic branding iron.=针头的尾巴再次压在我下腹的皮肤上。它开始用魔法烙铁雕刻咒语。
Ricca, please don't struggle...This will end soon as long as you stay still!=里卡，请不要挣扎。。。只要你一动不动，这一切就会结束！
My waist struggles to escape from the burning needle, but it can't move from the firm grip of the succubus.=我的腰挣扎着从滚烫的针头中逃脱，但它无法从魅魔的紧握中移动。
The woman's slender arms are unbelievably strong. Her long, supple fingers dig into the flesh of my tummy.=这位女士纤细的手臂难以置信地强壮。她柔软的长手指伸进我的肚子里。
Nnggggh...! Haaaaaaa... Let me go... Aaaaaagh...=嗯。。。！哈哈。。。放开我。。。啊啊啊。。。
Stop, I said quit moving...!=住手，我说别动了。。。！

Eeeeek... Aaaaaaagh, haaa, haaa... Aaagh... Aah... Aaaaaaaaah!=Eeeeek。。。哈哈哈哈哈。。。啊。。。啊。。。啊啊啊！
But as long as my body is restrained, I can't escape the branding iron, and I'm worried about what might happen if the succubus messes up the spell, as she had warned.=但只要我的身体受到约束，我就无法逃脱烙铁的烙印，我担心如果魅魔像她警告的那样扰乱了咒语，会发生什么。

The touch and warmth I feel from the fingers under the gloves...=我从手套下的手指感受到的触摸和温暖。。。
Miria's desperate expression... I've never seen her like this before...=Miria绝望的表情。。。我从没见过她这样。。。
The way her arm keeps gripping my tummy, even while it trembles from muscle cramps, deprives me of the will to resist.=她的手臂一直抓着我的肚子，即使它因为肌肉抽筋而颤抖，这让我失去了抵抗的意志。
Haaa, aaagh... Nnnhaaa.... Aaaah... Hhngh, eeek... Haaa... Haaaaaaa...=哈哈哈。。。Nnnhaaa。。。。啊。。。哼，嘿。。。哈。。。哈哈。。。
Oh, my... Nnh... Heehee, good girl... Hm... Just stay still like that...=哦，我的。。。嗯。。。嘿嘿，好女孩。。。陛下就这样别动。。。

The engraving of the curse picks up the pace after I stop resisting, and I start to see the complete pattern.=在我停止抵抗后，诅咒的雕刻加快了速度，我开始看到完整的图案。

Seeing the recomposed succubus' face makes me sweat, and sickly wet hair sticks to my forehead and cheeks.=看到重组后的魅魔脸让我汗流浃背，湿漉漉的头发粘在额头和脸颊上。

I recall what I saw in a human anatomy book left unsold at the general store. It had a diagram of the organ made for carrying children.=我回忆起我在一本人体解剖学书中看到的东西，这本书在杂货店没卖出去。它有一张用来抱孩子的器官图。

The shape will disappear soon, but don't worry. It'll come right back when the goblins rape you!=这个形状很快就会消失，但别担心。当哥布林强奸你的时候它就会回来！
The smiling demon takes her hand off her tail, and lightly strokes my scars with her fingers.=微笑的恶魔把手从尾巴上拿开，用手指轻轻抚摸我的伤疤。
Eek... Ah, aaaaaaaah, nngh, haaa... Stop... Aaaaaann... Nnngh, nnnhh... Aaaaaan...=哎呀。。。啊，aaaaaah，nngh，haaa。。。停止aaaann。。。嗯，嗯。。。啊啊啊。。。

Her gloved hand emits red, pulsing light from the palm. My marking then sucks in the light and glows in the same color.=她戴着手套的手从手掌发出红色的脉冲光。然后，我的标记会吸收光线，并以相同的颜色发光。
Aah, nngh... What, is this... My tummy... It's twisting and... Haaaah... It feels good...? Why...? Aaah...=啊，不。。。什么，这是。。。我的肚子。。。这是扭曲和。。。哈哈。。。感觉很好。。。？为什么？啊。。。
Every time my mark absorbs red light, it feels like the organs underneath my scars are churned.=每次我的疤痕吸收红光时，我感觉疤痕下面的器官都在翻腾。

Aaaaaaah, I-I'm gonna break! Aaah, my womb, nnnngh, it's gonna breaaaaaak!=啊啊啊，我要崩溃了！啊，我的子宫，它要呼吸了！
The marking's light gradually weakens, but then glows brightly like a candle just before it burns out.=标记的光线逐渐减弱，但在熄灭前会像蜡烛一样明亮地发光。

Hey, Ricca... What do you think of my present? Do you like it?=嘿Ricca。。。你觉得我的礼物怎么样？你喜欢吗？
The succubus asks me with delight while I'm still immersed in the pleasure of climax.=当我仍沉浸在高潮的喜悦中时，魅魔高兴地问我。
The Crest of Lust... This is a magic spell succubi use to dominate humans.=欲望的顶峰。。。这是一个巫婆用来统治人类的魔法。
Apart from the heart-shaped center, the womb-patterned burn marks on Ricca have disappeared. The only trace left of the carefully carved uterus and ovaries is a faint bruise.=除了心脏形状的中心，Ricca上子宫图案的烧伤痕迹已经消失。仔细雕刻的子宫和卵巢留下的唯一痕迹是一处轻微的瘀伤。
When Ricca returns from the white wonderland in her mind, the succubus Miria proudly explains the effects of the curse.=当Ricca从她心目中的白色仙境归来时，魅魔Miria自豪地解释了诅咒的效果。
According to her, the curse is powered by the victim's magic and works to keep the female body in a constant state of heat. The effect of the curse is proportional to the size of the marking.=据她说，诅咒是由受害者的魔法驱动的，可以让女性身体保持恒定的高温状态。诅咒的效果与标记的大小成正比。
The effect of the Crest of Lust also increases when it nears the magic of monsters.=当接近怪物的魔法时，欲望之冠的效果也会增加。
In other words, the marking will activate when the female's mucous membrane comes in contact with a monster's, or when parts of her body like her genitals, intestine, or mouth touch semen. It'll then return to the shape it was originally carved in.=换句话说，当雌性的粘膜与怪物的粘膜接触时，或者当她的身体部位，如生殖器、肠道或口腔接触精液时，标记就会激活。然后它会恢复到最初雕刻的形状。
And when the scars grow red and regain their original form, the crest will truly be completed.=当伤疤变红并恢复其原始形状时，纹章将真正完成。
Ricca shudders.=Ricca浑身发抖。
While the demoness happily explains the effects of the curse, her lower abdomen achingly shakes, and her labia drips with slimy juice.=当恶魔高兴地解释诅咒的效果时，她的小腹疼痛地颤抖，阴唇滴下粘稠的汁液。
In addition, getting raped by the monsters would further strengthen the curse.=此外，被怪物强奸会进一步强化诅咒。
The marking currently glows with 20 or 30 percent of its power, but she can't imagine how sexually excited she'll become when the crest is fully activated.=目前，这个标记的发光能力为20%或30%，但她无法想象当纹章完全激活时，她会变得多么性感。
Haaa... Haaa... Urk... How could you give me such a thing...?=哈。。。哈。。。U-Urk。。。你怎么能给我这样的东西。。。？
Ricca is frozen in shock, but the demon continues her explanation to rub more salt in her wound.=Ricca吓得僵住了，但恶魔继续解释，在她的伤口上擦了更多的盐。
She says that in proportion to the size of the crest, Ricca's erogenous zones will develop and enlarge, and her sweat and urine will emit an obscene smell that will fan the flames of male lust.=她说，与羽冠的大小成比例，Ricca的性欲区域会发展和扩大，她的汗水和尿液会散发出一种淫秽的气味，会激起男性欲望的火焰。
As the curse develops, her entire body will be able to feel sexual pleasure, and her real erogenous zones will become ten times more sensitive than the norm.=随着诅咒的发展，她的整个身体都能感受到性快感，她真正的性欲区域将变得比正常情况敏感十倍。
Ricca's body will transform into a more feminine figure, her breasts will swell, and they'll spray milk from sexual pleasure.=Ricca的身体会变成一个更女性化的形象，她的乳房会膨胀，她们会从性快感中喷出牛奶。
The milk will be heavy in magic to ensure her monster babies will grow strong and healthy.=牛奶将充满魔力，以确保她的怪物宝宝茁壮成长。
When the crest takes its complete form, Ricca's womb will never be able to conceive a human child, and it will instead transform into a reproductive organ dedicated to producing baby monsters of all kinds.=当盾徽完全成形时，Ricca的子宫将永远无法怀上人类的孩子，相反，它将变成一个生殖器官，专门生产各种各样的婴儿怪物。
And by showering the ovaries with powerful magic, they'll ovulate their ova and be ready to conceive monsters at any given time.=通过向卵巢注入强大的魔法，它们将排卵，并随时准备怀孕。
O... Ova...? Ovulation...?=哦。。。Ova。。。？排卵。。。？
That's right. Ova are the eggs in your stomach that turn into babies.=这是正确的。卵子是胃中的卵子，会变成婴儿。
And when a penis releases its semen inside you...the little tadpoles inside the white liquid gang up on the ovum and try to go inside it...=当阴茎在你体内释放精液时。。。白色液体中的小蝌蚪聚集在卵子上，试图进入其中。。。
The succubus continues to spout knowledge the naive village girl couldn't comprehend, but Ricca realizes that she is listening to meaningless details.=魅魔继续滔滔不绝地说着天真的乡村女孩无法理解的知识，但Ricca意识到她在听毫无意义的细节。
I used every spell effect I could think of in your curse. That's why it took a while to engrave. I'm sorry I made you go through that pain for so long♪=我在你的诅咒中使用了我能想到的所有法术效果。这就是为什么雕刻花了一段时间。很抱歉我让你经历了这么长时间的痛苦♪
But thanks to you holding still, I was able to carve it beautifully! Heeheehee...♪=但多亏你一动不动，我才把它刻得很漂亮！嘿嘿。。。♪
While the curse was being engraved into Ricca, Miria was gripping her stomach as it struggled and writhed in pain.=当咒语刻在Ricca身上时，Miria紧紧抓住她的肚子，痛苦地挣扎着。
Ricca noticed traces of her sister in the demon's grip and serious face, and so she stopped moving. But after seeing the succubus' smirk, she regretted ever letting her carve the curse into her.=Ricca注意到恶魔抓着她妹妹的痕迹和严肃的脸，所以她停止了移动。但在看到魅魔的傻笑后，她后悔曾经让她在自己身上刻下诅咒。
Haaa... Nnngh... Haaa... Haaa...=哈。。。嗯。。。哈。。。哈。。。
My body is hot... My pussy is burning, and it tingles every time the air strokes it.=我的身体很热。。。我的阴部在燃烧，每次空气吹拂时都会刺痛。
I'm hung upside down now, but my embarrassing juices are going against gravity. They won't stop overflowing...=我现在倒挂着，但我尴尬的果汁正逆地心引力而动。它们不会停止泛滥。。。
Ricca, it looks like you're in a lot of pain... But I have to put the goblin sex on hold...=Ricca，看起来你很痛苦。。。但我必须暂停与哥布林的性爱。。。
Slip... Slip...=滑倒滑倒
The succubus' black gloves stroke the indecent marking on my lower abdomen.=魔女的黑手套抚摸着我下腹的不雅痕迹。
Every time her gentle fingertips move, my vagina is struck by an aching sensation like it's being licked.=每次她温柔的指尖移动，我的阴道都会有一种被舔的疼痛感。
Nnnh, haaa... I'm not hoping... Nnngh... To get raped...=嗯哈。。。我不希望。。。嗯。。。被强奸。。。
I don't want to get raped by those disgusting, loathsome goblins.=我不想被那些恶心恶心的哥布林强奸。
And if what the succubus says is true, my curse is going to activate, and I'm sure to conceive a baby.=如果魅魔说的是真的，我的诅咒就会激活，我肯定会怀孕。
Yet, my body and my mind are at odds with each other...=然而，我的身体和我的思想是相互矛盾的。。。
Heehee, you're lying again... Your pussy's drooling all over. It's so hungry for cock, it's practically begging for it...=嘿嘿，你又在撒谎了。。。你的猫咪流着口水。它太渴望公鸡了，简直是在乞求公鸡。。。
But if you cum now, the spell I just carved into you might go out of control.=但是如果你现在加，我刚才刻在你身上的咒语可能会失控。
I'll have to ask you to be patient until the marking settles. You don't want to orgasm your sanity away, do you?=我得请你耐心一点，直到伤口愈合。你不想性高潮让你失去理智吧？
Orga... Nngh, my sanity...? Nngh... Haa...=奥加。。。我的理智。。。？嗯。。。哈。。。
*Schlick...*=*施利克*
I recall how I came from the goblin's penis, and I feel the inner depths of my pussy release even more fluids.=我回忆起我是如何从哥布林的阴茎中走出来的，我感觉我的阴部深处释放出更多的液体。
If that does happen, I'll look after you, but...I don't think mindless girls are these monsters' type...=如果真是这样，我会照顾你的，但是。。。我不认为愚蠢的女孩是这些怪物的类型。。。
Master Archlich said it's fine as long as you're alive, but as your sister, I prefer to hand you over after you've been properly disciplined.=阿奇Ricca大师说只要你还活着就好，但作为你的妹妹，我更愿意在你得到适当的训练后把你交出来。

Archlich... That's the evil wizard from the fairy tale Iris told me about.=阿奇Ricca。。。这就是艾瑞斯告诉我的童话故事中的邪恶巫师。
When I became a holy knight, he became my enemy. He's the monster who's been manipulating the goblins.=当我成为神圣骑士时，他成了我的敌人。他就是那个操纵哥布林的怪物。
And he's most likely the person who turned my sister into a demon.=他很可能就是那个把我妹妹变成恶魔的人。
Hearing my enemy's name from this mad succubus' mouth awakens the anger in me.=从这个疯狂的魅魔嘴里听到我敌人的名字，我心中的愤怒被唤醒了。

The thick cone-shaped needle has pierced through the uterine opening and is trying to push its way into the womb.=这根粗的锥形针头已经穿过子宫开口，试图将其推入子宫。
I can tell what's happening because of how sensitive the Crest of Lust makes my body.=我能说出发生了什么，因为欲望的顶峰让我的身体变得如此敏感。
Aaagh! Not that deep, not that deep! Nnngh, it's too deep! Eeeeeeeeeeek! It hurts... It's gonna breaaaaaaak!=啊！没那么深，没那么深！太深了！哎呀！很痛。。。它要呼吸了！
Heehee... That fairy friend of yours... She seemed pretty bright and skilled in magic, so... Hmm... In case you do escape this place... Aah... I want to put a curse on you that no one can break...=嘿嘿。。。你那位仙女般的朋友。。。她看起来很聪明，很擅长魔法，所以。。。隐马尔可夫模型。。。万一你真的逃离了这个地方。。。啊。。。我想给你下一个没人能打破的诅咒。。。
I'm going to, nngh, engrave the marking, hehee...on the inside of your stomach♪ Haha! With your current powers, you should be able to handle it... Aaaah...♪=我要，嗯，刻上记号，嘿嘿。。。在你的肚子里♪ 哈哈！用你现在的能力，你应该能应付。。。啊。。。♪
The demoness feverishly sighs and shakes her large breasts.=恶魔狂热地叹息，摇晃着她的大乳房。
I'm already sensitive and in heat because of the first crest. Getting another carved into the inside of my womb is driving me insane.=因为第一个波峰，我已经很敏感，很热了。在我的子宫里再刻一个让我发疯。
I struggle with all my might, forgetting that the curse is currently kept under control by the succubus' hand.=我竭尽全力挣扎着，忘记了诅咒现在由魅魔的手控制着。
Nooooooooo! Stooooooooooop! It hurts! It hurts inside me... I'm gonna break! Stooooooooooop!=不！嘘！疼！我内心很痛。。。我要崩溃了！嘘！
Geez... I told you not to struggle... Nngh, you're so tight... Well, heehee... I guess I can't blame you this time...=天哪。。。我告诉过你不要挣扎。。。你太紧了。。。嗯，嘿嘿。。。我想这次我不能怪你。。。
The tail in my tummy stops moving.=我肚子里的尾巴不动了。
Phew... Maybe it will go in smoothly after I make you give birth to a goblin baby...=呸。。。也许在我让你生下一个哥布林宝宝后，一切都会顺利进行。。。
Haaa... Aaah... No... I don't want to give birth... Uugh.. It hurts... Haa, haa... My insides... Please, stop it already... Urk, nngh...=哈。。。啊。。。不我不想生孩子。。。啊。。很痛。。。哈哈哈。。。我的内心。。。求你了，快停下。。。呃，嗯。。。
*Giggle* The needle at the end of my tail can be used to collect magic...but did you know that it's really meant for...=*咯咯笑*我尾巴末端的针可以用来收集魔法。。。但你知道这真的是为了。。。
I think this is the spot... Take that!=我想这就是。。。拿着！
The succubus pulls her tail out slightly, subtly changes its angle, and pushes it in once again.=魅魔轻轻地拉出尾巴，微妙地改变角度，再次将其推入。
*Shlippp! Shluck...!*=*Shlippp！祝你好运*
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!=哎哟，哎哟，哎哟！
The pain is so intense, it feels like my tummy is getting stabbed by spears.=疼痛是如此剧烈，感觉我的肚子被矛刺伤了。
The agony is then followed by a scorching sensation in my privates.=痛苦过后，我的私处有一种灼热的感觉。
And the other side too... Hyah♪=另一边也是。。。嗨♪
Aaagh, nnngheeeeeeeeeeeeeek!=啊啊，nnngheeeeeeek！
The needle pierces at the flesh near the hole in the back of my vagina. I feel it inject something into my mucous membrane.=针扎进我阴道后面的洞附近的肉里。我觉得它会把东西注入我的粘膜。
Stop... Shto... Hyeek... Aaaaaaaaagh...=停止Shto。。。Hyeek。。。啊啊啊啊啊。。。
I want to struggle and escape the pain, but my body lost all its strength.=我想挣扎着逃离痛苦，但我的身体失去了所有的力量。
A warm comfort spreads through my body from the depths of my pussy.=一种温暖的慰藉从我的阴部深处传遍全身。
Aahyaaaaaaaaa, ahyaaaaaaaaagh...=啊，啊，啊，啊。。。
My body turns limp and my mind goes blank. The moans leaking from my mouth don't have a hint of thought in them.=我的身体变得软弱无力，头脑一片空白。从我嘴里发出的呻吟没有一丝思想。
Heehee, I love that face... I sent magic to your marking to prevent you from moving your body...=嘿嘿，我喜欢那张脸。。。我给你的标记施了魔法阻止你移动身体。。。
But it looks like the drug from my tail made your mind go blank from pleasure...♪=但看起来我尾巴上的药让你的大脑从快乐中消失了。。。♪
Nnnghaaa, nnhaaaan... My womb, feels soooo gooood... You shouldn't be that deep in me, but... Aaaaah...=恩，恩，恩。。。我的子宫感觉很好。。。你不应该对我那么深，但是。。。啊啊。。。
You might not be listening...but I'll tell you anyway.=你可能没在听。。。但我还是要告诉你。
That drug I injected into the entrance of your uterus has the ability to reshape nerve cells.=我注射到你子宫入口的药物有重塑神经细胞的能力。
It looked like it wasn't working well, so I had to inject a lot of it... But unlike the magic curse, this can't be undone anymore.=看起来效果不太好，所以我不得不注射了很多。。。但与魔法诅咒不同的是，这不能再被撤销了。
From now on, any stimulus your insides get will turn into pleasure... I can't wait to see what'll happen when you give birth...!=从现在起，你内心的任何刺激都会转化为快乐。。。我迫不及待地想看看你生孩子后会发生什么。。。！
*Giggle* You might even get addicted to bearing children♪=*咯咯笑，你甚至可能会对生孩子上瘾♪
Aaaah... Hyaaaa... Eeek... Ahyaaaaaaaaaaann...♪=啊。。。哈哈。。。哎呀。。。啊，啊，啊。。。♪
My demon sister is saying something...=我的恶魔妹妹在说些什么。。。
But I can't concentrate because of the pleasure from my tummy...=但我无法集中注意力，因为我的肚子很舒服。。。
She must have done something cruel and naughty to me again...=她一定又对我做了什么残忍淘气的事。。。
Heehee, I think it's about time... Hyah...!=嘿嘿，我想是时候了。。。哈。。。！
Nnnhaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Aaaaaaaaah...<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color> It's deep, deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep...♪=nnnhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah。。。啊啊啊啊。。。<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color> 很深，迪伊伊伊。。。♪
The cone-shaped needle sticks itself into my uterine hole again.=圆锥形的针头又刺进了我的子宫孔。
The entrance of my uterus was in serious pain only a moment ago, but it has transformed into my strongest erogenous zone. I feel myself lose consciousness from the waves of pleasure.=就在刚才，我的子宫入口还很痛，但它已经变成了我最强烈的性欲区。我觉得自己在快乐的浪潮中失去了知觉。
Nnngh... I know it's hard for you... Nnnnh... But you can do it♪=嗯。。。我知道这对你来说很难。。。嗯。。。但你能做到♪
Aaah, aaaaaaah, my tummy...! It feels sooo goood! Aaaaaagh<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color> Aaaaaaaaaaaaannn...!=啊，啊，我的肚子。。。！感觉好极了！啊啊<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color> aaaaaann。。。！
The succubus' needle tail enters my uterus entrance, which is now more sensitive than my clitoris. It wiggles and pushes its way through.=魅魔的针状尾巴进入我的子宫入口，现在比我的阴蒂更敏感。它扭动并推动它通过。
D-Don't move like that! Not so deep! Aaaah! Don't move so much...inside me! It feels too good! Hyaa! Nyoooo<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>=别那样动！没那么深！啊！不要动太多。。。在我里面！感觉太好了！嗨！尼欧<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>
Since most of my power to think has been swept away by the pleasure, I don't notice that I have been moaning sweetly.=由于我的大部分思考能力都被快乐冲走了，我没有注意到我一直在甜蜜地呻吟。
Still, I try to twist and escape from the wiggling tail in my womb entrance, but my body only has strength enough for me to weakly shake my hips.=尽管如此，我还是试图从子宫入口处摆动的尾巴中扭动和逃脱，但我的身体只有足够的力量让我无力地摇晃臀部。
While I struggle, the swollen tip of the tail keeps pushing against my entrance, spreading my womb open with its coned needle.=当我挣扎时，肿胀的尾巴尖不断地推着我的入口，用它的锥形针头将我的子宫张开。
Aaaaaaaah, no, it's too much, I'm gonna break... Ricca's pussy... Ricca's mind, it's gonna breaaaaaaaaaaaaak<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>=不，太多了，我要打破。。。丽卡的阴部。。。Ricca的大脑会呼吸的<color%3D#FF7FCF>♥</color>
Oh, my. You're calling yourself by your name? It's just like when you were little... Heehee, just hold on a little longer... Nngh, haa... You can do it.=哦，天哪。你叫你自己的名字？就像你小时候。。。嘿嘿，再等等。。。嗯哈。。。你能行。
*Push...!*=*推*
Finally, my uterine entrance succumbs to pleasure. It is pushed completely open by the pressing tail.=最后，我的子宫入口屈服于快乐。它被按下的尾巴完全推开。
Nnngh... Hick, ack, heeeeeeeeeek! I'm cumming... I'm cumming I'm cumming I'm cumming I'm cumming I'm cummiiiiiiiing!=嗯。。。Hick，ack，Heeeeeeek！我要高潮了。。。我在开玩笑我在开玩笑我在开玩笑我在开玩笑我在开玩笑！
The tip of the tail firmly presses against my narrow uterus opening and enters it in one strong push, but the momentum causes it to pierce into my womb's innermost wall.=尾巴的尖端紧紧地压在我狭窄的子宫口上，用力一推就进入了子宫，但这种冲力使它刺穿了我子宫的最内壁。
The stimulation fires flickers of light in my eyes. My mind goes completely white from pleasure...=这种刺激在我的眼睛里闪烁着光芒。我的大脑因快乐而变得完全苍白。。。
Cumming... I'm cumming...! Khaaaaaaa... Nnghaaa... Haa...haa... I can't cum... No... I hate this... Nnngh... Haa...=卡明。。。我要高潮了。。。！卡瓦阿。。。Nnghaaa。。。哈。。。哈。。。我不能。。。不我讨厌这个。。。嗯。。。哈。。。
I can't cum... I want to cum... I thought I was finally going to cum...=我不能。。。我想。。。我以为我终于要。。。
The sense of approaching orgasm gradually fades away. The crest under the succubus' hand is absorbing it from my body.=接近性高潮的感觉逐渐消失。魅魔手下的纹章正从我身上吸收它。
Aaah... Aaaaagh...=啊。。。啊啊啊。。。
Yet my body still seeks relief. My vagina shakes and aches as it instinctively clenches on the demon's tail.=然而，我的身体仍在寻求解脱。当我本能地紧握恶魔的尾巴时，我的阴道会颤抖和疼痛。
*Chuckle* It's in all the way... This is where it really begins.=*咯咯地笑，一路走来。。。这才是真正的开始。
Really...begins...? Y...You mean...there's more...?=真正地开始。。。？Y你是说。。。还有更多。。。？

Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!=啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！

Scorching heat comes from the inside of my stomach.=灼热的热气从我的胃里冒出来。
It is a sign that the magic branding iron used on my skin is emerging again.=这是我皮肤上使用的神奇烙铁再次出现的迹象。
I-It burns... My tummy buuuuuuuuuuuurns!=它会燃烧。。。我的肚子好痛！
Hehe... I wonder which sensation will win? Pain or pleasure? Maybe it's pain since you aren't able to cum...=呵呵。。。我想知道哪种感觉会赢？痛苦还是快乐？也许这是因为你不能。。。
Haa, hot... Inside... Haaa, ack... It burns...=哈，热。。。在…内哈亚，阿克。。。它燃烧。。。
Her gloved left hand strokes the Crest of Lust engraved above my womb.=她戴着手套的左手抚摸着刻在我子宫上方的欲望之巅。
Her palm emits a faint glow of red light.=她的手掌发出微弱的红光。
I'll send magic into you through here to keep you from moving...=我会通过这里给你施魔法阻止你移动。。。
Heehee, it's okay if you wet yourself. I'll just have mister slime lick it and wipe you clean again, so I don't mind if you pass out.=嘿嘿，如果你把自己弄湿了没关系。我会让斯莱姆先生舔一下，再把你擦干净，所以我不介意你昏倒。
*Shluppp...*=*Shluppp*
The demoness pulls her tail out of my vagina, leans over, and places her right hand on my face.=恶魔把她的尾巴从我的阴道里拉出来，俯身，把右手放在我的脸上。
Her gentle hand pats and removes the hair stuck on my cheek, wet with sweat and tears.=她温柔的手拍打着我脸颊上被汗水和泪水浸湿的头发，并将其去除。
Hyeeeeh... Haaheeeeh...?=嘿。。。哈哈哈。。。？
The hand brings back memories buried deep in my mind. I recall how it helped me stop crying when I got lost in the mountains when I was little.=这只手让我想起了深深埋藏在我脑海中的记忆。我记得小时候在山里迷路时，它是如何帮助我停止哭泣的。
I've been tricked by her many times already...but maybe my sister is still somewhere in her soul...=我已经被她骗过很多次了。。。但也许我妹妹还在她的灵魂深处。。。
Ricca... You can do it♪=Ricca。。。你能行♪
I know that...demons are good at deceiving humans, but...=我知道。。。恶魔擅长欺骗人类，但是。。。
Ah... Don't...=啊。。。不要。。。
*Shlick... Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!*=*Shlick。。。流行音乐流行音乐流行音乐流行音乐流行音乐爸爸*
The demon smiles and pushes her tail back into me with force.=恶魔微笑着用力把她的尾巴推回到我身上。
She presses her branding iron into my most important and private organ to engrave the indecent curse inside me.=她把烙铁按进我最重要、最私密的器官，在我体内刻下不雅的诅咒。
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Aghaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!=啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！啊，啊，啊！
The tail in my vagina's path squirms and the hot needle at its tip glides against my inner walls as it burns the membrane.=我阴道里的尾巴蠕动着，针尖上的热针头在我的内壁上滑动，因为它会灼伤阴道膜。
Eeeeeeeeeeekkk! It burns! It burns! It buuuurns!=哎呀！烧起来了！烧起来了！太棒了！
The gem on my necklace brooch radiates and relieves the burning pain just slightly, but even divine protection can't save me from mind-numbing agony.=我项链胸针上的宝石散发出轻微的灼痛，但即使是神圣的保护也无法将我从麻木的痛苦中解救出来。
Aaaaaaaaaaagh! Aaaaaaaaagh, aaaaaaah..... aaaaaaah....!=啊啊啊！啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊。。。。。aaaaaaah。。。。！
The demon's tail wiggles inside me to draw the pattern. The orgasmic pleasure from my vagina and womb continues to assault me.=恶魔的尾巴在我体内摆动来画出图案。来自阴道和子宫的性高潮继续折磨着我。
*Sizzzzzzle...*=*嘶嘶作响*
Aaaaaaagh! I'm gonna break! Stooooop! My tummy! It's gonna melt!! Eeeek! Oooooooowwww!!=啊啊啊！我要崩溃了！笨蛋！我的肚子！它会融化的！！哎呀！呜呜呜呜！！
The intense pain from the uterus, and overwhelming pleasure right under it...=子宫的剧烈疼痛，以及子宫下的巨大快乐。。。
Both sensations are strong enough to make me faint, but they are polar opposites of each other.=这两种感觉都很强烈，足以让我晕倒，但它们是截然相反的。
The nerves in my body become confused, forcing the immobile muscles in my body to move, causing me to convulse.=我体内的神经变得混乱，迫使我体内静止的肌肉移动，导致我抽搐。

Mister merchant is going to be disappointed in me...=商人先生会对我失望的...

Ahahaha, everyone's a worrywart just like Miria... Oh, that's right...!=哈哈，每个人都像Miria一样忧心忡忡...哦，没错...！
I collected some Magic Stones while I was out picking the herbs. I wanted to buy something for Miria.=我在外面采药的时候收集了一些魔法石。我想给Miria买点东西。
Alright, just leave those here then. Give me a minute so I can count them.=好吧，那就把这些留在这儿吧。给我点时间，让我数一数。
Okay!=可以！
Hmm... Should I get her snacks, or something else...?=哼唔...我该给她买点零食还是别的什么...？
Be careful...=小心...
Oh, what's this gem? It's a necklace... It's so cute...!=哦，这是什么宝石？是条项链...太可爱了...！
Hm? Oh, that. I got it from a young mage girl earlier today in exchange for some medicinal herbs.=嗯？哦，那个。今天早些时候，我从一个年轻的法师女孩那里得到了它，以换取一些草药。
(<indent%3D0.4em>A mage girl...? I wonder if she made the magic sign I saw on the mountain path, too...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>一个法师女孩...？我想知道她是否也做了我在山路上看到的魔法符号...）
Heehee, I bet Miria would look really pretty with this necklace...=嘻嘻，我打赌Miria戴上这条项链一定会很漂亮...
The merchant's wife said she was feeling down lately, too...=商人的妻子说她最近也很沮丧...
Um...mister? Is it true that Miria looked like she was feeling down?=嗯...先生？Miria看起来情绪低落是真的吗？
Ugh, why'd she have to say that...? W-Well... I probably got the wrong idea.=她为什么要这么说...？嗯...我可能想错了。
One, ten, hundred, thousand... Urk...=一、十、百、千...哦吼...
I see... But still...I think I can splurge a bit. How much is this necklace again?=我明白了...但还是...我想我可以奢侈一下。 这条项链多少钱来着？
Ricca, do you want that necklace?=Ricca, 你想要那条项链吗？
Go on, you can take it. I'll give it to you in exchange for the Magic Stones.=去吧，你可以拿着。我把它给你，以换取魔法石。
Huh? But...I don't think there are enough stones for...=嗯？但是...我觉得没有足够的石头...
Huh? Yes... Oh, but... I can't...=昂？是呢...喔，但是，我不能...
It's fine. You're always helping out at my store, and you're going to give that to Miss Miria, right? Ghaha! I'd love to see that necklace on her as well.=没事。你总是在我的店里帮忙，你会把这个给Miria小姐，对吗？哈哈！我也想看看她戴项链。
Oh, mister... You really mean it?=哦，先生...你是认真的吗？
Thank you so much!=非常感谢！
Now hurry on back home and give that present to Miria. She's going to look beautiful with it.=现在赶快回家把礼物送给Miria。她戴上会很漂亮的。
Okay! I'll be back tomorrow to help out again. See you, mister!=好的！我明天再来帮忙。 再见，先生！
Hahaha, out you go! I'll have you look after the store tomorrow.=哈哈哈，走吧！明天我会让你照看这家商店。
Eek! Mister! Don't hit my butt!=哎呀！先生！别打我屁股！
Ghahaha! You're growing into a busty lady too! Say hello to Miria for me!=哈哈哈！你也在长成一个丰满的女子！代我向Miria问好！
Oh, mister... Alright, see you tomorrow!=哦，先生...好吧，明天见！
Oh, Ricca, you're back from the mountains.=哦，Ricca，你从山上回来了啊。
Oh, hello, ma'am. Excuse me, I need to get going.=你好，女士。对不起，我得走了。
Oh my, off already? She must be in a hurry to get back to Miria.=天哪，着什么急？是急着要找Miria啊。
Hey, what happened to the necklace that was here?=嘿，这个项链是啥情况？
Oh, the one with the gem? I, um, gave it to Ricca...=哦，有宝石的那个？ 我，嗯，我把它给了Ricca...
I can't imagine Ricca being able to afford it though... Don't tell me you didn't take any money...=但我无法想象Ricca能负担得起...别告诉我你没收她任何钱...
Well, um, I thought it would look good on Miss Miria... And it's not like I gave it to her for free...=我觉得戴在Miria小姐身上会很好看...我又不是免费给她的...
Alright, I'll forgive you for giving it to Ricca. I appreciate her for always helping out at the store, but...=好吧，我会原谅你把它送给Ricca，我很感激她总是在店里帮忙，但是...
Why have you been calling her sister "Miss" Miria lately?=你最近为什么叫她姐姐“Miria小姐”？
And you know what people call that gem you gave her, too, don't you!?=你也知道人们怎么称呼你给她的宝石吧！？
Well...I was talking about it in front of the church... I mean, at the dining hall... A busty girl like Miria could easily get a guy to marry if she just dressed sexier...=这个额...我在教堂前谈论这件事...我是说，在餐厅...像Miria这样的胸部丰满的女孩，只要打扮得更性感点，就很容易找到男人结婚...
Busty girl... Marry...? Don't stick your nose into other people's business, you perverted old man!=胸部丰满的女孩...？别插手别人的终身大事，你这个变态老头！
Eek...! Sorry! I didn't mean it like that!=哎呀...！很抱歉！我不是那个意思！
Those girls have been through a lot, though...=那些女孩经历了很多，不过...
Their parents died in the epidemic only two years after Ricca was born. But I guess that's what happens when a herb picker tries to play doctor...=她们的父母在Ricca出生两年后死于疫情。但我猜当一个采药者试图扮演医生时就会发生这种情况...
Back then, Miria was even younger than Ricca is now, but she was so put together.=那时，Miria甚至比现在的Ricca年少，但她是如此完美。
The town chipped in some money, but Miria raised Ricca pretty much on her own... I'm sure she wanted to have fun like most teenage girls, too.=镇上凑了些钱，但Miria基本上是靠她自己拉扯大了Ricca...我相信她也想和大多数十几岁的女孩一样，开开心心的。
She could've relied on others a little more...but I guess there weren't many people to rely on back then, either. A lot of people got sick.=她本可以再依赖别人一点...但我想当时也没有多少人可以依靠。很多人都生病了。
Yeah... And then some people started blaming the epidemic on Miria's family. They said that they brought the sickness when they moved in, or that someone as pretty as Miria must be a witch or a succubus...=是 啊...然后一些人开始将疫情归咎于Miria的家人。他们说她们搬进来的时候带来了疾病，或者像Miria这样漂亮的人一定是女巫或魅魔...
How ridiculous. It's far more likely that the sickness was brought in by some traveler.=真是荒唐！我看呐，这种病更有可能是由一些旅行者带来的。
Exactly. As proof, I'm healthy as can be, and I've been close to them all this time! I gave the asshole who started the rumor a good punch in the face.=确实如此。我可作证，我一直都很接近她们，而我如此健康！我狠狠地打了那个造谣的混蛋的脸。
That was so wonderful what you did... I wouldn't have fallen for you if it weren't for that.=你做的太棒了...如果不是因为这个，我不会爱上你的。
Ghahaha... Right? I used to feel so sorry for Miria back then, it was hard to even look at her. Even though she had those amazing breasts and ass...=哈哈哈...是么？正当那时，我对Miria的事很难过，甚至很难直视她。尽管她有着惊人的胸部和屁股...
But Ricca's all grown up now. It's about time Miria settled down, so I gave her that necklace as my way of supporting her, okay? It was a pure, kindhearted gesture...=但是Ricca现在都长大了。Miria该安顿下来了，所以我给了她那条项链作为我支持她的方式，好吗？这是一个纯洁、善良的表示...
And I'm telling you her private life is none of your business, pervert! And you were lying about how she seemed down, too!=我告诉你，她的私生活不关你的事，变态！你还撒谎说她看起来情绪低落！
Maybe it has something to do with how the monsters are getting restless... No, probably just a coincidence.=也许这与怪物们变得不安有关...不，可能只是巧合。
A lot of strange things have been happening lately... A bunch of slimes appeared, magical letters written in light came out of nowhere, and now I find a brooch and a doll...=最近发生了很多奇怪的事情...一堆史莱姆冒了出来，在光柱写下的魔法浮空字不知从哪里冒了出来，现在我又发现了一枚胸针和一个洋娃娃...
After I make up with Miria, I'll ask her to teach me how to make a little dress for her.=在我和Miria和好之后，我会让她教我如何为她做一件小裙子。
Hmm... This fairy doll is cute, but a little too risque... It would be kinda awkward to use her as an ornament in the house...=呃...这个仙女娃娃很可爱，但有伤风化...把她当作家里的装饰品会有点尴尬...
I don't care what happens to me... Please grant me a trial...=我不管发生什么事...请允许我试一试...
Well, if a traveler dropped this, I bet he'll stop by the village, so it's fine if I take these back with me for now, right?=好吧，如果一个旅行者丢了这个，我估计他会在村子附近停下来，所以我现在把这些带回去也没关系，对吧？
A brooch and a doll... I wonder if someone dropped them. But people from the village rarely come this way...=胸针和洋娃娃...我想知道是不是有人掉了。但是村里的人很少走这条路...
Woof?=汪汪？
If I just eat more, they'll get bigger in no time... Hey, what am I even talking about? Hehehe...=如果我多吃点，它们很快就会变大...哎呦，我到底在说什么？呵呵嘿...
I-I mean, I think my breasts are pretty big, too... I'm sure they'll grow more! I'm Miria's sister, after all!=我，我觉得吧，我的胸部也很大...我相信它们会长大的！我毕竟是Miria的妹妹！
Oh, for a little doll, her breasts are big. They might be as big as Miria's if she was human-sized...=哦，对一个小娃娃来说，她的胸部挺大呀。如果Miria和人类一样大的话...
Fairy's Puppet?=仙女木偶？
She's pretty too... What's this on her back? Wings...? She looks like those fairies I saw in my book.=她也很漂亮...她背上是什么？翅膀...？她的模样像我在书中看到的仙女。
It's...a brooch and a doll of a little girl... Wow, her skin and hair are so well made...=这是...一枚胸针和一个小女孩玩偶...哇，她的皮肤和头发做得真好...
*Whine*... *Whine*...=*呜呜*...*呜呜*...
Whoa!=哇！
Hey, you shouldn't run off like that, Polon...=嘿，你不应该跑那么欢，Polon...
*Whine*=*抱怨*
Woof woof!=汪汪汪！
Whoa!? Where are you going!? Be careful, there could be slimes around here!=哇！？你要去哪里！？小心，这附近可能有史莱姆！
*Pant* *Pant*... Woof!=*喘息**喘息*...汪汪！
Polon? What are you doing here...? Heehee, woof woof!=Polon？你在这儿干什么...？嘿嘿，汪汪！
*Pant* *Pant*=*喘息**喘息*
*Pant* *Pant*... Woof! Woof!=*喘息**喘息*...汪汪！汪汪！
But thank goodness I didn't see any slimes today. Anyway, I should start heading home.=但谢天谢地，我今天没有看到任何史莱姆。不管怎样，我该回家了。
Father, Mother... God... If my existence is holding Ricca back, then...=爸爸，妈妈...老天...如果我的存在是Ricca的枷锁，那么...
Hmm... I'll worry Miria if I come back home late. I don't want her to nag at me either... I better head back soon.=嗯...如果我回家晚了，Miria会担心的。我也不想她唠叨...我最好快点回去。
Huh...? Is that the church bell...? I think it's ringing earlier than it usually does. The sky isn't even dark yet.=哈...？教堂的钟声...？它比平时响得早些。天还没黑呢。
Alright... This should be enough herbs for Miria.=好了...这些药材对Miria来说应该足够了。
Maybe saying I wasn't going to talk to her was a little childish... I'll apologize when I get home...=也许我不想和她说话带点孩子气...我回家后会道歉的...
Tomato salad for dinner, huh... No, I'm sure Miria will make soup instead.=晚餐吃番茄沙拉，嗯...不对，Miria会做个别的汤。
Hmph! I hate my no-soup sister...! I'm not talking to you!=哼！我可不喜欢我不做汤的姐姐...！不跟你说话了！
Ah... Ricca...=啊...Ricca...
You're acting like a child again...=你又像个孩子了...
Whaaat? Well, fine! If you're not going to make tomato soup, I'm not going to talk to you anymore.=什么？好吧，行啊！如果你不做番茄汤，我就不跟你说话了。
*Sigh* Fake crying isn't going to work on me. It's about time you stopped being a picky eater.=*唉*，假哭对我没用。你该停止挑食了。
I do, but you shouldn't be a picky eater. I've already prepared the beans, so give the raw tomatoes a try, okay? You might find out you actually like them.=是的，但你不应该挑食。我已经准备好豆子了，所以试试生吃西红柿，行吗？你可能会发现你其实很喜欢它们。
No way... *Sniff*... I think tomato soup would be better... Tomatoes have slimy stuff around their seeds... Urk... *Sniff*=不可能...*吸气*...我想番茄汤会更好...番茄的种子周围有粘稠的东西...呃...*吸气*
Couldn't you put them in the soup? You know I don't like raw tomatoes...=你不能把它们放进汤里吗？你知道我不喜欢生西红柿...
The merchant's wife gave me a bunch yesterday. We need to eat them before they spoil.=商人的妻子昨天给了我一束。我们需要在它们变质之前吃掉它们。
Hmm... Soup, bread, and tomato salad... Huh!? What!? Tomato salad!?=嗯...汤、面包和番茄沙拉...蛤！？什么！？番茄沙拉！？
I'll have some bean soup and bread ready with a side of tomato salad.=豆子汤和面包，外加一份番茄沙拉。
Okay... What about dinner?=可以...晚餐吃啥？
Oh, actually, I'm not. I have today off, so I'm thinking of cleaning the church until evening.=哦，其实吧，没有。我今天休息，所以我想打扫教堂到晚上。
Urk... Geez, Miria! You're so persistent! Anyway, are you working at the dining hall again in the afternoon today?=额...天啊，Miria！你太固执了！不管怎样，你今天下午还在餐厅工作吗？
(<indent%3D0.4em>T-Tomboy...? Did she find out about how I beat up those smiles the other day...!?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>假，假小子...? 她是否发现了我那天是如何殴打那些史莱姆的...!)
Okay... As long as you understand... But I'm worried. A girl like you shouldn't be running around like a tomboy in patched clothes...=可以的...只要你明白...但我很担心。像你这样的女孩不应该像个穿着补丁衣服的假小子一样到处乱跑...
I know, I know. I'll be careful not to trip, and I'll come back right away if I see any monsters.=我知道，我知道。我会小心不要绊倒，如果我看到任何怪物，我会马上回来。
That would be great... Um, Ricca, the mountains have...=那太好了...嗯，Ricca, 山上有...

Geez...=天哪...
I guess the only thing I want is for my sister to stop being a worrywart and give me more independence.=我想我唯一想做的就是让我姐姐不再忧心忡忡，让我更加独立些。
Helping out at the shop is fun, and I don't get bored of playing with Polon and the forest animals. I'm even getting a little fatter from all the delicious meals I eat...=在商店帮忙很有趣，我并不会厌倦和Polon以及森林里的动物嬉戏。何况我尝过这么多佳肴，变得有点儿胖了...
You say that, but I doubt it. Heehee! And I'm already plenty happy right now!=你这么说，但我很怀疑。 嘻嘻！而且我现在已经很开心了。
Well... I might... But if it means you'll have a happy family of your own, I can put up with it.=好...我可能...但如果这意味着你会有一个幸福的家庭，我可以忍受。
Are you talking about that again? Wouldn't you be lonely if I left you and started living on my own, Miria?=你再说一遍？如果我离开你，开始独自生活，你会不会感到孤独，Miria？
I would. Our parents in heaven will be sad if both of us die single...=我会的。如果我们两个都形单影只地死去，我们在天堂的父母会很伤心...
Ahaha! You're exaggerating. Besides, I wouldn't mind that.=啊哈哈！你太夸张了。我不介意的。
That's not true... I don't hate you... But if you keep living in the village, every day will be just like any other day. We'll both end up as old ladies before we know it.=胡说...我不恨你...但是如果你继续住在村子里，每一天都活得差不多。不知不觉，我们都会变成老太太。
I cost too much money to feed. That's why you hate me... Whaaaaaah!=我花了太多的钱来养活自己。这就是为什么你恨我...哇啊啊！
Urk, *Sniff*... You want me out of the house... Don't you...?=噜，*吸*...你想让我出去...是吗...？

Hey, Miria... Why are you trying to get me to move...? Oh... Am I...a burden to you?=嘿，Miria...你为什么要让我搬家...？ 哦...我是...你的一个负担吗？
I see... Then how about the town in the west? I heard they have a very fine church there.=我懂了...那西部的城镇呢？我听说那里有一座很好的教堂。
Hmm, the port town, huh... That's near the ocean, right? I'm not good at swimming, though... The capital has too many people, too. I got dizzy in those crowds when we went to visit Olivia for her wedding.=嗯，港口小镇，嗯...就在海边，对吗？不过我不擅长游泳...首都的人口也太多了。我们去为了参观Olivia的婚礼时，在人群中我都感到头晕。
Hey, Ricca. Have you ever thought about leaving this village? I recently had a customer from the eastern port town saying they were looking for new help to hire.=嘿Ricca. 你想过离开这个村子吗？我最近有一位来自东部港口城镇的客户说，他们正在寻找新的雇佣助手呢。
I have some money saved up, so if you want to, we could get you a place to live in the port town. Or maybe a young lady like you would prefer the capital?=我存了些钱，如果你愿意，我们可以在港口城市给你找个地方住。 还是说像你这样的年轻女士更喜欢去首都？

They're finally living a happy life and don't need our meddling. Let them do what they like.=他们终于过上了幸福的生活，不需要我们的干涉。让他们随心所欲吧。
You think so...? I just think it's a waste that such a pretty girl hasn't found a husband yet...=我只是觉得这么漂亮的女孩还没有找到丈夫，真是太可惜了...

(<indent%3D0.4em>*Yawn* I slept too much again...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>*打哈欠*我又睡过头了…）
(<indent%3D0.4em>I think I had a dream last night, too... Maybe because Miria came to wake me up over and over...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我想我昨晚做了个梦...也许是因为Miria一次又一次地来叫醒我…）
(<indent%3D0.4em>I stayed up late last night reading this "Strange Creatures Encyclopedia" I borrowed from the general store. I thought it would have cute critters in it, but it was mostly monsters. Still, it was so interesting I couldn't put it down...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我昨晚熬夜看了这本从杂货店借的《奇异生物百科全书》。我以为里面会有可爱的小动物，但大部分都是怪物。尽管如此，它还是很有趣，我爱不释手…）
Ricca, hurry up and come over here.=Ricca, 快点过来。
Okay! I gotta change first, so hold on a sec.=可以！我得先换衣服，等一下。

Don't go too deep into the mountains, okay? I've heard that monsters are getting restless around here lately...=不要深入山里，好吗？我听说最近这里的怪物越来越不安...
...Miria, this again?=...Miria, 又来这套？
I'm just worried, Ricca. I was talking with a customer, and he said that the town you and I went to some time ago got taken over by monsters. I heard the forest settlement at the foot of this mountain got attacked by goblins, too.=我只是担心，Ricca.。我之前和一位顾客谈话，他说你和我前段时间去的那个城镇被怪物占领了。我听说山脚下的森林定居点也遭到了哥布林的袭击。
Wasn't that town really far away, though? And we only went there when we were young. The forest settlement didn't suffer much, either. You're worrying too much.=不过，那个小镇不是离这真的很远吗？我们小时候才去那里。森林定居点也没有受到太大影响。你太担心了。
Besides, we have Donny patrolling the outskirts of this village, and the only monsters we see on the mountain road are the occasional slime. It's the same as it ever was.=此外，我们有Donny在这个村庄的郊区巡逻，我们在山路上看到的唯一怪物是偶尔出现的怪物史莱姆。和以前一样。

I searched for you in and out of the village, but then you just popped out of the church!=我在村子里到处找你，但最后你从教堂底下走了出来！

We rarely get earthquakes around here, but after that incident, the ground shook and some parts of the underground tomb collapsed, you know? I bet it was God showing us how mad he was at you.=我们这里很少发生地震，但在那次事件之后，地面震动，地下墓穴的一些部分坍塌，你知道吗？我打赌是上帝在向我们展示他对你有多生气。
Urk... That was a long time ago, and I already apologized for that. How many times are you going to bring that up? It's getting annoying.=唔...那是很久以前的事了，我已经为此道歉了。你要搬出来多少次？真的烦人。
Oh, do I really talk about it that often? Speaking of which, where were you hiding all that time? I thought I searched the church inside and out... Or were you...=我真的经常讲吗？话说回来，你一直躲在哪里？我在教堂里里外外都找遍了...还是你...

See you later... Careful not to trip on the mountain path! And if you see any monsters, come back home right away!=再见...小心别在山路上绊倒！如果你看到任何怪物，马上回家！
Heehee, I know, I know!=嘿嘿，我知道，我知道！

Anyway, what's with Miria? She seemed really worried...=不管怎样，Miria怎么了? 她似乎真的很担心...

I'm glad she's always looking after me and all, but I wish Miria would find herself a husband soon.=我很高兴她一直在照顾我和所有人，但我希望Miria 她早日找个丈夫。

Maybe she hasn't gotten married so she can keep taking care of me...=也许她还没有结婚，是因为这样可以继续照顾我...

Heehee, Miria told me the same thing. She's such a worrywart...=嘿嘿，Miria也这么说。她真是个忧心忡忡的人...
That's because you're very important to her. *Chuckle* You are her precious little sister, so of course she's going to worry.=那是因为你对她很重要*笑*吧，你是她的宝贝妹妹，所以她当然会担心的。
Heehee... Thanks! But, to be honest, I think she should stop looking after me so much. She could easily find a husband for herself if she tried...=嘿嘿...谢谢！但是，说实话，我觉得她应该停止过分照顾我。她可以很容易地为自己找到一个丈夫，如果她尝试...
I agree, Miria is a beautiful lady, just like you.=我同意，Miria是一位美丽的女子，就像你一样。
She gets so many opportunities to talk to travelers at the dining hall. If she just wore flashier clothing instead of the plain dress she always wears, she could get all the men she wanted...=她有很多机会在餐厅与游客交谈。如果她只穿更华丽的衣服，而不是她一直穿的朴素的衣服，她可以得到她想要的所有男人...

I would wear a blouse that showed my cleavage, and a frilly short skirt that exposed my thighs and just barely hid my panties...=我会穿一件露出乳沟的衬衫，一条露出大腿的褶边短裙，几乎只遮住内裤...

Oh? It's nothing. I'm just saying, I think Miria could find a nice man if she dressed in sexier clothes. Heeheehee.=哦没什么。我只是说，我想Miria 如果她穿着更性感的衣服就能找到一个好男人。嘿嘿。
Sexier, huh... Ahaha... I-I guess so. I think she would look better in cuter clothes too, but she always dresses really drab...=更性感，嗯...啊哈...我，我想是的。我想她穿更可爱的衣服也会更好看，但她总是穿得很单调...
Absolutely. She didn't always dress so plainly, you know. When Miria first moved to this village with your parents, she was fashionable just like girls her age ought to be.=肯定的。你知道，她之前可不这样。Miria和你父母刚搬到这个村子时，她和她这个年龄的女孩一样时尚。
Oh, really? I've only seen her dress like how she does now...=哦，真的吗？我只见过她现在的样子...
No wonder, this was around the time you were born.=难怪，那会儿你才刚出生呢。
By the way, I heard from my husband that Miria's been looking a bit down these days. Is she alright?=顺便说一下，我丈夫告诉我Miria这几天看起来有点沮丧。她还好吗？
Oh, he said that? I didn't notice anything strange about her...=哦，他是这么说的？我没注意到她有什么奇怪的地方...
Oh, is that so? My husband must have misunderstood something then. Sorry to worry you.=哦，是这样吗？我丈夫一定是误解了什么。抱歉让你担心。

Yes, ma'am!=好嘞，女士！
Oh, it's Polon.=哦，是小狗Polon.

Woof!=汪！
Hey, it's Ricca. Hi there. You sure do get along with Polon.=嘿，是Ricca.，你好。你真的和Polon相处良好啊。
Hi, Donny.=你好，Donny。
You're going to the mountains again? Be careful of the monsters. They've gotten a lot more active lately...=你又要去山上了？小心那些怪物。他们最近变得更活跃了...
Ahaha... Not you too. The lady from the general store and my sister told me the same thing.=啊哈...你也。杂货店的那位女士和我姐姐也告诉了我同样的事情。
I bet. Miria can get pretty wound up worrying for you, but I don't think I can blame her. You can get a bit high-spirited sometimes.=我敢打赌。Miria 会为你担心，但我不认为我配责怪她。你有时会有点兴高采烈。
But she's right. It's been about three years since I was deployed to this village, but the monsters have gradually increased in number, and they're getting a little more violent.=但她是对的。自从我被派到这个村子已经三年了，但是怪物的数量逐渐增加，变得更加暴力。
Really? All I see are the occasional slimes squirming around, so I didn't think anything had changed.=真的？我所看到的只是偶尔蠕动的史莱姆，我觉得什么都没变。
It's something I learned from regularly making rounds and writing records. You shouldn't underestimate slimes, either.=这是我从经常巡视和写记录中学到的：你不应该低估史莱姆。
Slimes may be slower compared to other animals, but they sneak up to their prey in search of bodily fluids. Back when I was at the capital, I heard stories about elderly folks and children falling victim to them.=与其他动物相比，史莱姆的速度可能较慢，但它们会偷偷靠近猎物以寻找体液。当我在首都的时候，我听到了老人和儿童成为受害者的故事。
Small children? Oh, that's awful... Actually, I think I remember getting chased by one when I was small, too. It stings if you touch their bodies...=小孩子？哦，太糟糕了...其实吧，我还记得我小的时候被一个追过。触碰他们的身体就会感到刺痛...
If enough slimes surround you, even an adult can become paralyzed and get eaten by them. So you better be careful, Ricca. I don't want to see Miria cry because something happened to you.=如果足够的史莱姆在你周围的话，即使是成年人也会瘫痪，被它们吃掉。所以你最好小心点，Ricca.。我不想看到Miria 因为你发生了什么事而哭泣。
Heehee... Don't worry, I'll be careful.=嘿嘿...别担心，我会小心的。
Okay, I'll see you later!=好的，回头见！
See you! Be careful not to trip! And come right back if you see a monster, alright?=再见！小心别绊倒了！如果你看到怪物，马上回来，好吗？
Ahaha, alright!=啊哈，好吧！
Eek!=哎呀！
Uh, ugh... Hey, what are these green squirmy things...?=呃，呃...嘿，这些绿色蠕动的东西是什么...？
Slimes...? There weren't this many when I was last here..=史莱姆...？我上次来的时候没有这么多...
Ugh, they're so slimy... I can't stand these things. Welp, I guess I'm not getting any herbs today.=呃，它们太粘了...我受不了这些事。嗯，我想我今天没有草药了。

Huh!? Wh-What makes you say... Did the merchant's wife tell you...?=呵呵！？你，你为什么这么说...商人的妻子告诉你的吗...？
I heard her talking loud and clear. She was practically shouting in front of the house. I know full well I dress plainly, but men who are attracted to flashy girls usually aren't any good.=我听见她说话了，声音洪亮而清晰。她几乎是在房子前面大喊大叫。我很清楚我穿得很朴素，但被花哨女孩吸引的男人通常都不好。
I-I see... Ahaha...=我，我明白了...啊哈哈...
*Sigh* I appreciate you worrying about me, but don't you have anyone you're interested in?=*唉*，我很感激你为我担心，但是你没有感兴趣的人吗？
Your friend Olivia from the blacksmith family married a man from the royal capital when she was around your age, so I don't think you're too young for marriage.=你的铁匠家族出身的朋友Olivia，在你这么大的时候，娶了一个皇城男人。所以我觉得你现在结婚不早了。
Well... I don't really have any boys I like... I mean, Donny is about the only young man in this village who's single...=嗷呜...我真的没有喜欢的男孩...我是说，Donny是这个村子里唯一一个单身的年轻人...
There are no other girls around my age either. Olivia was the only one.=也没有别的女孩在我这个年纪。Olivia是唯一的一个。
Ugh......mon...ster... Look...ing for....knigh...t...=啊......怪...物...寻找......骑士...
(<indent%3D0.4em>......Mon...sters...?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>......怪物...？）
(<indent%3D0.4em>...no......plea..........run.....aw...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>...不...求...跑...）









——————————————【主线】第九话剧情开始——————————————————
Proceed to stage<line-height%3D125%>\r\nChapter 9 Writhing Sludge?=游玩关卡<line-height%3D125%>\r\n第九章扭动污泥？
Ominous Swamp=不祥沼泽

Urk... Nngh... Haa... Haa... Huff... Nngh... Ugh...=乌尔克。。。嗯。。。哈。。。哈。。。生气地说嗯。。。呃。。。
(<indent%3D0.4em>My body... It sometimes starts to throb and yearn for pleasure because of the curse...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我的身体。。。有点次 因为诅咒开始悸动，渴望快乐……）
(<indent%3D0.4em>I occasionally touch myself a little...while Iris is asleep... But I'm God's servant, his holy knight... I shouldn't be so naughty... So corrupted... If Iris found out...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我偶尔摸一下自己。。。虽然Iris 她睡着了。。。但我是上帝的仆人，他的神圣骑士。。。我不该这么调皮。。。如此堕落。。。如果Iris 发现…）
Uugh... Nngh, aah... Huff, huff... Nngh... Haa...=啊。。。啊，啊。。。哈夫，哈夫。。。嗯。。。哈。。。
Your curse is aching again, huh? Hold still for a sec; I'll re-apply the seal.=你的诅咒又开始痛了吧？等一下；我会重新盖上封条。
Haa... Haa... Iris... Thank you...=哈。。。哈。。。Iris... 非常感谢。
It gets stronger when there are monsters nearby... It must react to evil magic. Ugh, you just had to get cursed, didn't you?=当附近有怪物时，它会变得更强大。。。它必须对邪恶的魔法做出反应。你只是被诅咒了，不是吗？
Heh... I-I'm sorry...=嘿。。。对不起。。。
Um... Iris...? Is there a Drain Crystal around here?=嗯。。。Iris...? 这附近有排水水晶吗？
There is... I can sense evil magic being released from the depths of this swamp.=有。。。我能感觉到邪恶的魔法正从沼泽深处释放出来。
We can reduce the number of monsters by destroying the Drain Crystal, right?=我们可以通过摧毁排水水晶来减少怪物的数量，对吗？
That's right. Drain Crystals absorb the magic from the earth and transfer it elsewhere while emitting waves of evil, attracting monsters and driving them wild.=这是正确的。排水水晶吸收来自地球的魔法，并将其转移到其他地方，同时释放出邪恶的浪潮，吸引怪物并将其赶走。
Once the Drain Crystal is destroyed, the number of monsters will decrease. You'll get a load of Magic Stones to strengthen your abilities with, too. Like killing two birds with one stone.=一旦排水水晶被摧毁，怪物的数量就会减少。你也会得到大量魔法石来增强你的能力。就像一石二鸟。
When you were defeated at the goblin fortress...I realized that you aren't strong enough to beat Archlich or even that demon woman yet...=当你在哥布林要塞被击败时。。。我意识到你还没有强大到足以打败阿奇Ricca甚至那个恶魔女人。。。
The magic I felt from her was on a different level. It seems like she's able to disguise herself as a human, too. We can't just ignore her.=我从她身上感受到的魔力在另一个层面上。看起来她也能把自己伪装成人类。我们不能忽视她。
You want to get your sister back from the monsters, don't you? If you keep strengthening your holy knight abilities, even an idiot like you will have a chance to defeat them.=你想把你妹妹从怪物那里救回来，是吗？如果你继续强化你的神圣骑士能力，即使像你这样的白痴也有机会打败他们。
...Idiot...=...蠢人
Oww... Alright. Let's keep looking for more Drain Crystals to destroy.=哦。。。好吧让我们继续寻找更多的排水晶体破坏。
x11=x11
The Drain Crystal is some distance ahead... I guess we have to get through the swamp to reach it.=排水晶体在前面一段距离。。。我想我们得穿过沼泽才能到达。
It doesn't look that deep, but the mud will get caught on your legs and slow your movements. It'll make it harder to dodge enemy attacks, so try to walk on land when possible.=看起来没那么深，但泥巴会沾到你的腿上，减缓你的动作。这将使躲避敌人的攻击变得更加困难，所以尽可能在陆地上行走。
Okay. Although, I'm sad that it'll ruin my outfit right after it was repaired... The swamp water's so muddy and filthy...=可以虽然，我很难过，它会毁了我的衣服后，它被修复。。。沼泽的水又脏又泥泞。。。
x2=x2
Worrying about filth isn't going to get us any closer to the Crystal. Still, we don't know what could be lurking in the swamp, so be careful.=担心污秽不会让我们离水晶更近。尽管如此，我们仍然不知道沼泽中可能隐藏着什么，所以要小心。
There's a hell plant here too...=这里也有地狱植物。。。
The evil magic of the Drain Crystal must have affected the vegetation around here.=排水水晶的邪恶魔力一定影响了这里的植被。
X Key / 1 Button=十、键 / 1.按钮
The red and blue lotus leaves seem to move in response to your magic. It could be useful for us to move forward.=红色和蓝色的荷叶似乎随着你的魔法而移动。这对我们向前迈进可能是有益的。
Upon grapple defeat by Mudrot Orc\r\n"Mud orc assimilation" \r\nH scene (Already seen)=在被穆德洛特兽人击败后\n“泥兽人同化”\nH场景（已经看过）
Eeep! A big mud ghost...!=哎呀！一个大泥鬼。。。！
I think...that's an undead orc.=我想。。。那是一个不死兽人。
Orc? Those are the pig-faced monsters, right...?=兽人？那些是猪脸怪物，对吧。。。？
Yes. They're green demi-humans like goblins, but they're much larger and greedier.=对他们是像哥布林一样的绿色半人，但他们更大更贪婪。
Open=打开
I'm guessing it got stuck in the swamp and died, then the Drain Crystal's magic reanimated its corpse.=我猜它被困在沼泽里死了，然后排水水晶的魔法让它的尸体复活了。
It looks like it can't move from that spot, but watch out.=看起来它不能从那个地方移动，但要小心。
That monster has acidic vomit made of gastric acid and spoiled food in its stomach. If it barfs on you, your armor and clothes are going to melt away.=那怪物胃里有由胃酸和变质食物组成的酸性呕吐物。如果它吐在你身上，你的盔甲和衣服就会融化。
Melt away...!? Ugh, that's disgusting! I'm not letting that get on me!=融化掉。。。！？真恶心！我不会让这件事影响我的！
Some monsters are weak to elements like fire and ice. Hell beetles and monsters that live in water tend to be vulnerable to lightning.=有些怪物对火和冰等元素很弱。生活在水中的地狱甲虫和怪物往往容易受到闪电的伤害。
By the way, your holy knight armor and gauntlet are weak to lightning, too.=顺便说一句，你的神圣骑士盔甲和护手对闪电也很弱。
I see... So that's why my demon sister's lightning magic hurt so much...=我懂了。。。所以这就是为什么我的恶魔姐姐的闪电魔法如此之痛。。。
Obtained Silver Magic Stone=获得银魔法石
Your armor's divine protection reduces damage, though, so it should save you from fatal wounds. What I'm worried about is you exaggerating the pain and getting caught while you're busy whining...=不过，你的盔甲的神圣保护可以减少伤害，所以它可以让你免于致命伤。我担心的是你夸大了痛苦，在你忙着抱怨的时候被抓住了。。。
Are you sure about divine protection? Miria's purple lightning hurt so much, I couldn't move my body.=你确定神的保护吗？米莉亚的紫色闪电太刺痛了，我无法移动我的身体。
Don't talk like that - you're a holy knight! Gosh, you really need to learn to persevere... Your big sister Miria spoiled you rotten, didn't she?=别这么说-你是个神圣的骑士！天哪，你真的需要学会坚持。。。你姐姐Miria把你宠坏了，是吗？
You don't have to say it like that... Ugh... That's not...true...=你不必那样说。。。呃。。。那不是。。。符合事实的
Hell beetles... They're dangerous on land, but I especially don't want to deal with them around these swamps...=地狱甲虫。。。它们在陆地上很危险，但我尤其不想在沼泽地附近与它们打交道。。。
If you can't avoid their attacks in the mud, you can strike them right as they come at you.=如果你无法避免他们在泥泞中的攻击，你可以在他们向你袭来时直接攻击他们。
<b>Thunder Sword Crystal</b>\r\n Collecting a thunder sword crystal\r\n will infuse your weapon with the power of lightning for a short time.\r\n You can shock weak enemies to stop them in their tracks\r\n and deal massive damage to\r\n aquatic monsters, insects, birds or enemies who wear armor.=<b>雷剑水晶</b>\r\n 收集雷霆剑水晶\n将在短时间内给你的武器注入闪电的力量。\n你可以震慑弱小的敌人，阻止他们前进\n并对其造成巨大损害\n水生怪物、昆虫、鸟类或穿盔甲的敌人。
Your weapon has been infused with Lightning magic=你的武器被注入了闪电魔法
Eww... My whole body's covered in mud...=哎呀。。。我全身都是泥。。。
My hands and feet are a mess, too... It feels so gross... Ugh... I smell like mud...=我的手和脚也一团糟。。。感觉太恶心了。。。呃。。。我闻起来像泥。。。
Heehee... But I just need to switch back to my normal form...=嘿嘿。。。但我只需要回到我的正常状态。。。
...and immediately transform again, and I'll be clean!=...马上再变一次，我就干净了！
(<indent%3D0.4em>Yup... All clean and pure... If I keep repeating the transformation, the inside of my stomach should become clean... I can get rid of all the filth the goblins put in me...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>是的。。。一切都干净纯净。。。如果我不断重复这个转变，我的胃内部应该会变得干净。。。我可以把哥布林放在我身上的所有污垢都清除掉……）
Heehee... Heeheehee...! God gave me such wonderful powers! So convenient!=嘿嘿。。。嘿嘿。。。！上帝给了我如此奇妙的力量！太方便了！
Hey, every time you transform into a holy knight, you consume magic. I know you want to be clean, but you've been transforming way too much lately. Can't you put up with a bit of dirt?=嘿，每次你变成神圣骑士，你都会消耗魔法。我知道你想保持清白，但你最近改变太多了。你不能忍受一点灰尘吗？
Huh... H-Have I...? Alright...=呵呵。。。我有没有。。。？好吧
I can feel the magic from a Drain Crystal in that direction. Let's go.=我能从那个方向的排水晶体中感受到魔力。走吧。
Okay... Ah, wait up, Iris...!=可以等等，Iris...!
On the way through the swamp to break another Drain Crystal...=在穿过沼泽去打破另一个排水水晶的路上。。。
(<indent%3D0.4em>*Sigh*)=(<indent%3D0.4em>*叹息*）
(<indent%3D0.4em>It's been about a week since we left the goblin fortress, but she's still in a bad mood... I guess it only makes sense. I'm always making her angry...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我们离开哥布林要塞已经一周了，但她仍然心情不好。。。我想这是有道理的。我总是让她生气……）
(<indent%3D0.4em>She only talks to me to reseal my curse, even when we're walking together... She hasn't found out about the goblins raping me...or what I do while she's asleep...has she?)=(<indent%3D0.4em>她只会跟我说话来解除我的诅咒，即使我们在一起散步的时候。。。她还没发现妖精强奸我的事。。。或者我在她睡觉的时候做什么。。。她有吗？）
(<indent%3D0.4em>But... Ugh... This is so awkward... I don't want it to be like this forever... I wanna get along with her...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>但是呃。。。这太尴尬了。。。我不想永远这样。。。我想和她相处……）
U-Um... Iris...?=嗯。。。Iris...?
What is it?=这是怎么一回事？
Umm, you're God's servant... I mean, God's messenger, right?=你是上帝的仆人。。。我是说，上帝的使者，对吧？
What about it?=怎么样？
What kind of person is God...? Oh, I guess he isn't a person, heehee... You've talked to him directly, right?=上帝是什么样的人。。。？哦，我猜他不是一个人，嘿嘿。。。你直接跟他谈过，对吧？Why do you want to know?=你为什么想知道？
Huh...? Why...? Well... Um, I'm just surprised that God really exists...and I wanted to know more about you...=呵呵。。。？为什么？好我只是很惊讶上帝真的存在。。。我想更多地了解你。。。
Hmph... Fine. I suppose you have the right to know. This is going to take a while to explain...=嗯。。。好的我想你有权知道。这需要一段时间来解释。。。
My fellow fairies and I live in a forest in the mountains far northeast of here.=我和我的仙女们住在这里东北偏僻山区的一片森林里。
Mountains far northeast... Aren't those mountains super tall...?=远在东北的山脉。。。那些山不是很高吗。。。？
Yes, they are. My ancestors lived quietly in that forest surround by mountains. It was a peaceful land very few approached.=是的。我的祖先安静地生活在群山环绕的森林里。这是一片很少有人接近的宁静之地。
Yet suddenly, ferocious monsters began to appear... Just like this area.=然而突然，凶猛的怪物开始出现。。。就像这个地区。
So our ancestors climbed the mountain and prayed. Then God came down from the heavens before them...=所以我们的祖先爬上山祈祷。然后上帝在他们面前从天而降。。。
...and drove away the monsters with a dazzling light, shining like the sun.=...用耀眼的光芒赶走了怪物，像太阳一样闪耀。
Well, that's the folklore that's been passed down in our village through the ages, but God really does periodically come to the forest to put up barriers and drive away foreign invaders with magic.=好吧，这是我们村子里流传多年的民间传说，但上帝确实会定期来到森林里设置屏障，用魔法赶走外国侵略者。
Huh... To be honest, it didn't really hit me even after I was chosen to be a holy knight, but... I guess God really does exist.=呵呵。。。说实话，即使在我被选为神圣骑士后，我也没有真正受到打击，但是。。。我想上帝真的存在。
Yes, but unlike what you humans believe, God isn't actually all-powerful...=是的，但和你们人类所相信的不同，上帝并不是万能的。。。
Our God is probably more like a high-ranking spirit or something close to a wraith... No, I shouldn't think like that - it's disrespectful...=我们的神可能更像是一个高级精灵或是一个接近幽灵的东西。。。不，我不应该那样想-这是不尊重。。。
In any case, God uses holy light magic to keep the balance between living creatures and protect us, just like the myth says.=在任何情况下，上帝使用圣光魔法来保持生物之间的平衡并保护我们，就像神话所说的那样。
God wants peace for this world and its inhabitants, and we fairies help our God by collecting information from various places, sometimes becoming God's hands and feet. That's how we return the favor for God protecting us.=上帝希望这个世界和它的居民和平，我们仙女通过从不同的地方收集信息来帮助我们的上帝，有些地方次 成为神的手和脚。这就是我们回报上帝保护我们的方式。
I see... So what kind of person... What kind of God is he?=我懂了。。。那么什么样的人。。。他是什么样的上帝？
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I was one of the most outstanding among the young fairies of my village. I wasn't just made God's servant, I was given a name.=我不是故意吹嘘自己，但我是村里最杰出的小仙女之一。我不仅仅是上帝的仆人，我还被赋予了一个名字。
God always takes the form of a woman when she appears in our village. She looks dignified, but she's also very kind.=当女人出现在我们村子里时，上帝总是以女人的形象出现。她看起来很端庄，但也很善良。
Oh? So she was a Goddess... W-Wait, does that mean the holy sisters at church aren't God's wives, then...?=哦所以她是一位女神。。。等等，这是否意味着教堂里的神圣姐妹不是上帝的妻子，那么。。。？
She may often appear as female, but she's able to take many different forms, so I don't know if that's her true form.=她可能经常以女性的身份出现，但她能够采取许多不同的形式，所以我不知道这是否是她的真实形式。
*Chuckle* She can be mischievous, too. One time, she surprised me by transforming herself to look like me...=*笑吧，她也可能很淘气。有一次，她让我惊讶，她把自己变成了我的样子。。。
Wow... Really...?=哇！真正地
One day, God told us that the world would soon be filled with evil power and that monsters would run rampant. She even told us that the seal the previous holy knight put on the Darkfiend Dragon is on the verge of being broken...=有一天，上帝告诉我们，世界很快就会充满邪恶的力量，怪物会猖獗。她甚至告诉我们前一位神圣骑士戴在黑暗之龙上的封印即将被打破。。。
That's why she gave me the duty to look for the new savior - the one chosen to become a holy knight - and deliver the brooch to her, and accompany her in her quest to fight evil.=这就是为什么她让我有责任寻找新的救世主——被选为神圣骑士的救世主——并将胸针交给她，陪伴她与邪恶作斗争。
I see... So that's why you came to me...=我懂了。。。这就是你来找我的原因。。。
If I can accomplish my duty, God will continue to protect my village.=如果我能完成我的职责，上帝将继续保护我的村庄。
I want to protect my friends and family from wild animals, monsters...and humans...=我想保护我的朋友和家人不受野生动物和怪物的伤害。。。而人类。。。
Protect them...from humans...? What does that... Oh... The fairies in the freak shows at the capital...=保护他们。。。来自人类。。。？这意味着什么。。。哦首都怪物秀中的仙女们。。。
Tsk... It's not just that...=Tsk。。。不仅仅是。。。
We fairies are small and weak...and not all fairies are good at magic like me.=我们精灵又小又弱。。。并不是所有的仙女都像我一样擅长魔法。
It's only natural for other species to target us for magic and food. It's survival of the fittest, after all...=其他物种为了魔法和食物把我们作为目标是很自然的。毕竟，这是适者生存。。。
I hate them for it...but I understand why humans capture fairies to make a show out of them... But I don't get why humans and demi-humans...=我恨他们。。。但我明白为什么人类会抓住仙女来表演。。。但我不明白为什么人类和半人类。。。
Why do they break our limbs, strip us of our wings, and stab us with tree branches? How can they treat us like toys...?=为什么它们会折断我们的四肢，剥去我们的翅膀，用树枝刺伤我们？他们怎么能像对待玩具一样对待我们。。。？
I don't get it... Do they enjoy doing that? What have we ever done to your kind!?=我不明白。。。他们喜欢这样做吗？我们对你们做过什么！？
I... I don't...=我我不。。。
I know a fairy who had her stomach ripped by fingers from the inside... And another one who got ejaculated into so much she burst! Why can't they just simply kill us!? Why do they use us and then throw us away!?=我认识一个仙女，她的胃被里面的手指撕裂了。。。还有一个射精太多了，她就爆了！为什么他们不能直接杀了我们！？为什么他们利用我们然后把我们扔掉！？
What... Ejaculated...? That's...just cruel...=什么射精。。。？那是。。。太残忍了。。。
Cruel...? Of course it's cruel! All my brother did was go to his usual spot to pick some nuts...! To gather...what I asked him to get for me the day before...=残酷的当然很残忍！我哥哥所做的就是去他通常去的地方摘些坚果。。。！收集。。。前一天我让他给我买的东西。。。
...Iris... I didn't know...=...Iris... 我不知道。。。
Hmph... And you're on the side of those cruel humans...aren't you?=嗯。。。你站在那些残忍的人类一边。。。你不是吗？
I-I am not! *Sniff* I'm sure...only evil people do such cruel things... They're evil!=我不是*嗅嗅，我确定。。。只有邪恶的人才会做这样残忍的事。。。他们是邪恶的！
Evil? So are you saying all the humans that approach my village are evil?=恶毒的你是说所有接近我村子的人都是邪恶的？
Hick... I am... *Sniff*...ngh... The people of my village...would never do something so cruel...=乡巴佬。。。我是*嗅嗅*。。。嗯。。。我们村的人。。。永远不会做这么残忍的事。。。
Are you sure? The other fairies have told me that among those cruel humans they've seen children much younger than you.=你确定吗？其他仙女告诉我，在那些残忍的人类中，他们见过比你小得多的孩子。
Ngh... No... I... No one... They don't want to be cruel... Those children...probably didn't know what they were doing...=嗯。。。不我没有人他们不想变得残忍。。。那些孩子。。。可能不知道他们在做什么。。。
Hick... They aren't... Hick... ugh...hick... They're not all... Hick...=乡巴佬。。。他们不是。。。乡巴佬。。。呃。。。乡巴佬。。。他们不全是。。。乡巴佬。。。
*Sniff*... Oww... Hick... *Sniff*... I'm not... Hick... *Sniff*... *Sniff* Waaaaaah...=*嗅嗅*。。。哦。。。乡巴佬*嗅。。。我不是。。。乡巴佬*嗅嗅**嗅嗅，哇啊。。。
I know... I know you're not like those humans. You're a special human who was chosen to be a holy knight...=我知道。。。我知道你不像那些人。你是一个被选为神圣骑士的特殊人类。。。
Hick... Oww... *Hick... Y-Yeah... *Sniff*...hick...=乡巴佬。。。哦*乡巴佬。。。是的*嗅嗅*。。。乡巴佬。。。
It seems that a different village in the north does trade with humans, and God insisted that only some humans are evil... Not that I'm ready to believe that...=似乎北方的另一个村庄与人类有贸易往来，上帝坚持认为只有一些人是邪恶的。。。并不是说我已经准备好相信。。。
Ugh... Hick...=呃。。。乡巴佬。。。
Hmph... I'm sorry I yelled at you... Forget what I said...=嗯。。。对不起，我对你大喊大叫。。。忘了我说的吧。。。
Chapter 9    Writhing Sludge=第九章扭动污泥

For years, I've been training in the magical arts to get strong enough to avenge my comrades and get back at the humans who did terrible things to them... But you humans have short lives. If we leave you alone, you'll eventually die, anyway...=多年来，我一直在接受魔法艺术方面的训练，以变得足够强大，为我的同志报仇，并报复那些对他们做了可怕事情的人。。。但你们人类的寿命很短。如果我们不理你，你终究会死的，不管怎样。。。
To tell you the truth, I don't care what happens to humans. They're unjust, filthy creatures. I don't understand why God lends her power to your kind...=说实话，我不在乎人类会发生什么。他们是不公正、肮脏的生物。我不明白为什么上帝会把她的力量借给你们。。。
Still, this is the decision of the God who protects my village. I'll fulfill the duty she assigned me no matter what.=不过，这是保护我村庄的上帝的决定。不管发生什么事，我都要履行她指派给我的职责。
Monsters are another matter, of course, and we fairies are too small and weak to fight. Your kind prays to God as well, so it makes sense that she chose a human to save the world. It doesn't sit right with me personally, though...=当然，怪物是另一回事，而我们精灵太小太弱，无法战斗。你们也向上帝祈祷，所以她选择了一个人来拯救世界是有道理的。不过，我个人并不这么认为。。。
That's the reason I'm helping your kind.=这就是我帮助你们的原因。
I see...=我懂了。。。
I know that you're not the same as the humans who attacked my comrades... You must be a virtuous and pure person. Still, if you're going to fulfill your destiny as a holy knight, I need you to become stronger.=我知道你和袭击我同志的人不一样。。。你必须是一个善良纯洁的人。不过，如果你想完成你作为神圣骑士的使命，我需要你变得更强大。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Pure...huh...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>纯净的嗯……）
Judging by the way you speak, you must have grown up without struggle or hardship. You mentioned your parents are dead, so is it because of that female?=从你说话的方式来看，你一定是在没有挣扎或艰辛的环境下长大的。你说你父母死了，是因为那个女人吗？
Don't call her that... It's true that Miria took care of me, but I've had struggles in my life, too...=别这么叫她。。。没错，米丽亚照顾过我，但我的生活中也有挣扎。。。
Like...?=喜欢
Well... Um... I had to walk on dangerous mountain paths and risk tripping, and tending the general store can get boring... And I'm poor, so I only get hand-me-down clothes, and Miria wouldn't make tomato soup like I asked her to...=好嗯。。。我不得不走在危险的山路上，冒着被绊倒的风险，照看杂货店可能会变得无聊。。。我很穷，所以我只买旧衣服，而米莉亚不会像我要求的那样做番茄汤。。。
Stop. I've heard enough. *Sigh* Looks like I have to be even stricter with you. Good grief, why did God have to pick you?=停止我听够了*唉，看来我得对你更严格了。天哪，为什么上帝要选你？
You always run blindly ahead without listening to me. That's how you got stuck with that curse... You can't even appreciate the cooking I do for you...=你总是盲目地向前跑，不听我的话。这就是你被诅咒的原因。。。你甚至不能感激我为你做的菜。。。
I get that you're not used to fighting, but I still see hesitation in your sword swings. And yet, when I try to help you practice, you immediately get tired...=我知道你不习惯打架，但我仍然能看到你挥剑时的犹豫。然而，当我试着帮你练习的时候，你马上就累了。。。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Urk... I just wanted to get along with Iris, but I only made her mad at me... I shouldn't have talked to her...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>乌尔克。。。我只是想和你好好相处Iris, 但我只是让她生我的气。。。我不该和她说话……）
I've taught you how to purify crystals before, but you still can only make simple things, right?=我以前教过你如何净化水晶，但你仍然只能做简单的东西，对吗？
We can go over it again, so try to review what you learned yourself.=我们可以再复习一遍，所以试着复习一下你自己学到的东西。
O-Okay...=好吧。。。

There's a large cave at the bottom of the ocean located between this port town and that island. There's a monster called Poseidon living there, and it sinks boats.=在这个港口城镇和那个岛之间的海底有一个大洞穴。那里住着一个叫波塞冬的怪物，它会把船弄沉。
Poseidon...? Isn't that the old sea god that resides in the waters around here...?=波塞冬...？那不是住在附近水域的老海神吗...？
That's right. Poseidon almost never appeared in front of humans. However, he's been spotted more frequently over the past year. He's been attacking boats.=这是正确的。波塞冬几乎从未出现在人类面前。然而，在过去的一年里，他被发现的频率更高。他一直在攻击船只。
Because of Poseidon, many of the merchant ships that used to sail around here have been sunk... Apparently, the sea god is protecting that island...=因为波塞冬，许多曾经在这里航行的商船都沉没了...显然，海神在保护那个岛...
That island was rumored to host a large nest of monsters, so a couple months ago, the capital's fleet headed over to investigate.=据传那个岛上有一个巨大的怪物巢穴，所以几个月前，首都的舰队前往调查。
Poseidon sank half of the ships that headed towards that island. The boats were snapped in half by snake-like arms that wrapped around them.=波塞冬击沉了一半驶向该岛的船只。船被缠绕在船上的蛇形手臂一分为二。
The soldiers that managed to reach the island weren't even able to conduct a proper investigation, and most of them perished on the way back...=成功抵达该岛的士兵甚至无法进行适当的调查，他们中的大多数人在返回途中丧生...
So I'm sorry, but we can't have any boats going out to sea. We'll just be sending you and our sailors to their deaths...=很抱歉，我们不能让船出海。我们只会送你和我们的水手去死...
I see... So you're telling me...if we get rid of this sea god, you'll let us borrow a ship?=我懂了...你是说...如果我们除掉这个海神，你会让我们借一艘船吗？
Huh? Yes... Do you have some idea on how to get rid of Poseidon, Miss Ricca...?=嗯？对小姐，你知道怎么摆脱波塞冬吗Ricca...?
I'm...going to go defeat Poseidon! Don't worry, I've fought against a village's guardian dragon before, too!=我是去打败波塞冬！别担心，我以前也和一个村子的守护龙作战过！
*Sigh* Were you listening to what the captain was saying at all?=*唉* 你到底在听队长说什么吗？
The sea god lives in a cave at the bottom of the sea. How do you plan to get there?=海神住在海底的一个洞穴里。你打算怎么去那里？
Huh...? Well... I was hoping you'd have some sort of magic spell, Iris...=呵呵...？好我希望你能施点魔法，Iris...
I don't have anything like that! I've always known you were stupid and short-sighted, but I swear you've gotten even dumber lately!=我没有这样的东西！我一直知道你很愚蠢，目光短浅，但我发誓你最近变得更蠢了！
What...!? Iris! So you do think I'm stupid! You can be pretty hurtful sometimes...=什么Iris! 所以你认为我很愚蠢！有时候你会很伤人次...
Don't get carried away just because you've gotten a little stronger. I'm glad you're feeling better, but I can't have you fooling around when the Darkfiend Dragon is about to be resurrected...=不要因为你变得更强壮了就得意忘形。我很高兴你感觉好多了，但我不能让你在黑暗之龙即将复活的时候鬼混...
Um... Miss Ricca... We can send word to the capital, and have them send a ship as a diversion...=嗯...未击中Ricca... 我们可以向首都发送消息，让他们派一艘船转移注意力...
You want to get to the cave at the bottom of the sea, right...?=你想去海底的洞穴，对吗...？
Claret...?=Claret...?
Leave it to me... I have an idea!=交给我吧...我有个主意！

I wonder how long it's been since I was caught by this monster.=我想知道这是多久，因为我被这个怪物抓住了。
My mother and sister's hand-me-down clothes were torn, and I was kicked onto the grassy ground.=我的母亲和妹妹的手掌衣服被撕裂了，我被踢到了草地。

After the gritty tongue licks around my mouth, it tries to push its way into my closed lips.=在嘴唇舔嘴巴舔，它试图将其倾向于我封闭的嘴唇。

It's been a while since we went into battle together like this. Huh, Iris?=这是一段时间，因为我们像这样一起战斗。\n呵呵，Iris？

Whoa, what a high cliff... Those big rocks must've rolled down from the top of the mountain. How dangerous...=哇，什么高悬崖......那么那些大岩石必须从山顶上滚下来。\n有多危险......
Hey, what do you think about riding those rolling boulders? Hoping on top of them should be easy as pie for a holy knight like you, right?=嘿，你怎么看待乘坐那些滚石巨石？\n希望他们的顶部应该很容易，因为你喜欢你的馅饼，对吗？
I used to ride on my village's cows when I was younger, but...I've never heard of knights riding boulders...=当我年轻的时候，我曾经骑在我的村庄的母牛上，但是......我从未听说过骑士骑行......
Ugh, so hot... The gaps between my toes feel so gross... Are we any closer to the Drain Crystal...?=呃，太热了......我的脚趾之间的差距感觉如此粗糙......我们是否越来越靠近黑暗水晶......？
It should be close by. Hang in there.=它应该关闭。\n挂在那里。

Really? Well... Considering your talents and age...=真的吗？\n嗯......考虑你的才华和年龄......
You don't seem to have a talent for magic, nor do you have the motivation to study, so I think the most you could do is learn a weak spell that creates a small spark of fire. I think it'd be impossible for you to learn any spells that would be useful in combat.=你似乎没有魔法人才，你也没有学习的动力，所以我认为你能做的最多是学习一个弱咒，产生了一个小火花的火焰。\n我认为你是不可能学习在战斗中有用的任何法术。

What, you're interested in magic? You already use it in your sword throwing skill.=什么，你对魔法感兴趣？\n你已经在剑扔技能中使用它。

But your sword uses very advanced magic. It materializes in an instant without a magic circle, right?=但你的剑用非常先进的魔法。\n它在没有魔法圈的瞬间实现了吗？
Is it actually that impressive? Personally, I think the kind of magic you use is a lot more fancy and cute, Claret...=它实际上是令人印象深刻的吗？\n就个人而言，我觉得你使用的那种魔法是更加美丽和可爱的，克罗尔......

*Sigh* Your mission as a holy knight is to defeat monsters. You have no use for showy magic...=*唉*您的使命作为圣骑士是击败怪物。\n你没有用于炫耀魔法......
Actually, I don't know if it's cute, but there is one flashy skill.=实际上，我不知道它是否很可爱，但有一个很华的技巧。
What, really...? What kind of skill?=什么，真的......？\n什么样的技能？
Heheheh, it's called "Holy Geyser"! It's God's greatest technique. She invented it to combat the great dragon that dwells in the darkness.=呵呵，它被称为“神圣的喷泉”！\n这是上帝最大的技术。\n她发明了它，打击伟大的龙，在黑暗中居住。
God's...greatest technique...=上帝......最大的技术......
Hmm... Sounds kinda dangerous...but it must be pretty flashy! Heehee! I can't wait to use it myself!=嗯...听起来有点危险......但它必须非常华丽！\n嘻嘻！\n我迫不及待想要自己使用它！
Don't get your hopes up. You'd need to go through rigorous training to use that skill.=不要让你的希望。\n您需要经历严格的培训来使用这种技能。
Heehee... But a whiny baby like you could never endure it.=Heehee ......但是像你这样的疯狂的宝贝永远不会忍受它。
Baby...!? I'm not a baby! I swore to become a great knight worthy of serving God! Iris, teach me how to use that Holy Something skill!=婴儿...！？\n我不是宝贝！\n我发誓成为一个值得一位服务上帝的伟大骑士！\nIris，教我如何使用那个神圣的技巧！
Alright, I want you to get stronger anyway, so I'm willing to help you train... Heh... But when you give up right away, don't blame me!=好吧，我希望你无论如何都要变得更强壮，所以我愿意帮助你训练......嘿......但是当你马上放弃时，不要责怪我！
I will not! Throw me everything you got! I won't flinch!=我不会！\n扔给我你得到的一切！\n我不会退缩！
Heehee... Then I'll hold you to your word. Mage, you help me, too.=heehee ......然后我会抱你的话。\n法师，你也帮我了。
Heehee! Yes, ma'am!=嘻嘻！\n是的女士！

Apparently, she's going around destroying the big red crystals inside monsters' territories. I heard a rumor that the red crystals attract monsters and make them violent.=很明显，她正在破坏怪物领地内的红色大水晶。我听说有传言说红色水晶会吸引怪物，让它们变得暴力。

Compared to all the training, monster fighting, and Drain Crystal hunting you do, this trip is nothing.=与所有的训练、怪物战斗和黑暗水晶 如果你想打猎，这次旅行就没什么了。
Heehee... I guess I have been working hard lately, but I've gotten used to it. So where's the inn?=嘿嘿...我想我最近一直在努力工作，但我已经习惯了。客栈在哪？

Going back in time, to a day before Claret's house was attacked by Orcs...=回到过去，到克萨尔的房子被兽人袭击之前的一天......
What!? You've read all the books in here, Claret!?=什么！？\n你在这里阅读了所有书，克罗尔！？
Yes, most of them. You're welcome to read whatever tickles your fancy!=是的，大多数人。\n欢迎您阅读您的花哨的速度！
I can? Then...don't mind if I do...=我能？\n然后......不要介意我是否这样做......
Wow, this book... The text is so dense, and it's filled with strange patterns... I don't think I can read these characters...=哇，这本书......文字是如此密集，它充满了奇怪的模式......我不认为我能读取这些角色......
The books around there are my father's collection of healing spells. Piled over here are my mother's combat magic books.=周围的书籍有我父亲的愈合法术。\n堆在这里是我母亲的战斗魔法书籍。
Wow... That's amazing... I fall asleep reading books if they aren't filled with pictures. I can't read anything too difficult, either...=哇......这真是太棒了......如果没有填满图片，我就会睡着了阅读书籍。\n我无法阅读任何太难，要么......
I like stuff like encyclopedias on animals and plants.=我喜欢像动物和植物上的百科全书这样的东西。
I think most people are like that. I only read these because I'm a mage living in the middle of nowhere. I have nothing else to do when I'm bored.=我想大多数人都是这样的。\n我只读这些，因为我是一个生活在茫茫荒野的法师。\n当我无聊时，我没有别的事情要做。
So that's how you got so smart... Even though you're younger than me...=所以这就是你那么聪明的方式......即使你比我年轻......
Heehee! I bet I know more about magic than the mages in the royal capital! I know a lot of things you don't, too, Ricca!=嘻嘻！\n我打赌我更了解魔法比皇家资本的法师更了解！\n我也知道你不做的事情，也是你的话！
Hmm... Is that so...=嗯......那是......
Then...do you know about succubus crystals...?=然后......你知道魔术晶体吗？
Succubus crystals...? That's a common name for a kind of light-red gem. What about them?=魅魔水晶......？\n这是一种浅红色宝石的常见名称。\n他们呢？
One time...I gave one to someone as a present. Oh, I didn't buy it for them, though. I gave what I received from someone else as a gift...=一次......我给了一个人作为礼物。\n哦，我没有为他们买它。\n我给了我从别人那里收到的礼物......
I was just wondering if that person who gave it to me knew what it was... He said that a mage that visited the village dropped it off, but... I wonder if he knew...about the color... You know?=我只是想知道那个把它给我的人知道它是什么......他说一个参观村里的法师把它放下了，但是......我想知道他是否知道......关于颜色......\n你懂的？
"You know"...? About what? You're still talking about that rock that's made out of powdered life crystal and magic stone, right?=“你懂的”...？\n关于什么？\n你还在谈论那块岩石，它是用粉状的生活水晶和魔法石做出的吗？
By the way, the light-red color comes from the mixture of pink life crystal and deep-red magic stone.=顺便说一下，浅红色来自粉红色的寿命和深红色魔石的混合物。
I see... But that isn't what I was asking about. I heard that the crystal's color represents a girl's...=我明白了......但这不是我问的。\n我听说水晶的颜色代表一个女孩......
A-Actually, never mind. Heehee... I think they're pretty, but I guess they're not that popular, huh?=实际上，没关系。 heehee ......我认为他们很漂亮，但我想他们不是那么受欢迎，呵呵？
Umm...? I suppose due to their lack of clarity, they aren't often worn as gemstones.=嗯......？\n我想由于他们缺乏清晰度，他们通常不作为宝石磨损。
They're not completely worthless, though. Because refining magic stones can be difficult, and they can be used as little good-luck charms, they're relatively expensive. They're good substitutes for carrying around money.=但是，他们并不完全毫无价值。\n因为精炼魔术石块可能很困难，所以它们可以用作少许好运的魅力，它们相对昂贵。\n他们是携带金钱的好替代品。
Yes, indeed.=确实是的。
I also know that some regions think the succubus crystal signifies the color of a woman's genitalia. They're typically just called pink crystals around here, though...=我也知道一些地区认为魔术水晶表示女人的生殖器的颜色。\n他们通常只是在这里叫粉红色晶体，但是......
G-Genitalia...!? Umm... Does that mean... H-Hey... So you did know, Claret!?=G-Genitalia ......！？\n嗯......这是否意味着...... H-嘿......所以你已经知道了，克萨尔！？
Heehee, you were trying to get me flustered, weren't you? Hehe! Too bad it didn't work!=Heehee，你试图让我变得慌乱，不是吗？\n呵呵！\n太糟糕了，它不起作用！
I may be younger than you, but I'm pretty knowledgeable!=我可能比你年轻，但我非常了解！
U-Urk... I see...=你看到...
(<indent%3D0.4em>I thought Iris taught me a lot of stuff, but... I guess I'm no match for her when it comes to knowledge about magic...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>我以为♥教我很多东西，但是......我想我觉得魔术知识时对她没有匹配......）
Yup! Heehee! Would you like me to teach you what I know?=对！\n嘻嘻！\n你想让我教你我所知道的吗？
(<indent%3D0.4em>Whoa, Claret's eyes are glittering... She must love teaching people. She's been letting me stay at her place for a while now, so I don't want to hurt her feelings...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>哇，克萨尔的眼睛是闪闪发光的......她必须喜欢教人。\n她一直让我留在她的地方，所以我不想伤害她的感情......）
S-Sure... Maybe you could teach me a little...=肯定......也许你可以教我一点......
Alrighty, then! I'm a little surprised by how childish you can be, though, Ricca. Did you really think you could embarrass me with that little tidbit?=好吧，然后！\n我有点惊讶你可以幼稚，Ricca。\n你真的认为你能用那个小的潮汐难堪吗？
Am I that childish...? I-I mean, I know a lot of things too, like...this and that...<size%3D50%>I have...experience too... Even if it was forced... Ugh *Sob*...</size>」=我是那个幼稚......？\n我 - 我的意思是，我也知道很多东西，就像......这个......<size%3D50%>我有......体验......即使它被迫......呃*呜咽* ...</size>」
You do? Heehee! Oh, I know... If you're going to travel back to your village, I'll teach you how to make rare crystals. They'll come in handy for your trip.=你做？\n嘻嘻！\n哦，我知道......如果你打算回到你的村庄，我会教你如何制作稀有水晶。\n他们会派上你的旅行。

I see... So those monsters attacked your village...=我明白了...所以那些怪物袭击了你的村庄...
Mister, you know about the monsters...?=先生，你了解怪物...？
I do... I was on my way to your village with a message for Donny, but a horde of monsters came from the direction I was heading...=嗯...我正在前往村庄，因为Donny报了信，但是一个部落的怪物在前路涌现...
I knew I didn't stand a chance fighting against them alone, so I was hiding here until it was safe... Before I knew it, it was the dead of night.=我知道我没有机会独自对抗他们，所以我躲在这里，直到变得安全点...唉，恐怖的死亡一夜。
I see... Um... D-Did you see anyone captured by the monsters?=是啊...嗯... 你，你看到任何被怪物捕获的人了吗？
No, I didn't... I was too focused on hiding from the monsters, I didn't notice any women...=不，我没有...我太专注于躲避怪物，我没有注意到任何女人...
A-Actually... I think I heard a woman's scream faintly among the voices of the goblins.=实，实际上...我听到了一个女人在哥布林的声音中微弱地尖叫。
Scream!? Mister, do you know where she... Do you know which direction those monsters went!?=尖叫！？先生，你知道她在哪里...你知道这些怪物的方位吗！？
They were going down the mountain in that direction... Are you looking for that woman...?=他们自那个方向走下了山...你在找那个女人吗？
I am... That woman was probably my sister...=我是...那个女人可能是我的姐姐...
Is that so... But a girl like you shouldn't be out here alone...=那么...但是像你这样的女孩不应该独自出来...
Um... I-I'll be fine... I defeated all the monsters left in my village, too.=嗯...我，我会没事的...我也击败了我村里留下的所有怪物。
You don't say? I can't tell from your appearance, but you must be very strong...=别胡说？从你的外表上可看不出来，但你肯定非常强大...
I'm sorry. I'm certain I heard a scream... If only I was strong like you, I could have saved her...=对不起。我确定我听到了一个尖叫...只要我像你一样强壮，我就可以救她...
No, it's not your fault...=不，这不是你的错...
I'm so sorry... *Sniff* Damn it... Why couldn't I... I couldn't move my feet, and... Urk...=我很抱歉... *抽泣*草了...为什么我不能...不能迈向前去...
What a pathetic man. You're wasting your time talking to this human. Let's move on.=多么可怜的人。你正在浪费你的时间与这个人交谈。让我们继续前进。
Huh? I heard a voice coming from my body... Oh, it's Iris... Okay, we can go, but...=啊？我听到了我身体的声音...哦，是Iris...好吧，我们可以去，但是...
Uh... Um, mister, I have something I want to ask of you...=呃...嗯，先生，我有想问你的事情...
Could you go to my village? I defeated the monsters on my way here, so there shouldn't be any left...=你能去村里吗？我在路上击败了怪物，所以应该不会留下任何...
I think the village is safe now, but Donny was hurt, and there might be a few monsters around the village...=我认为这个村庄现在是安全的，但Donny受到了伤害，村里可能有几个怪物...
I want you to help the people there...!=我希望你帮助那里的人...！
Can you...do that for me...?=你能...为我这么...做吗？
Alright, I'll go to your village... I was on my way there to contact Donny, anyway. I might as well fulfill my duty...=好吧，我会去你的村庄...无论如何，我正在联系那里的Donny。我也可以履行我的职责...
Thank you so much... Please be careful!=非常感谢...请小心！
The plants here are withered, too? But slimes were the only monsters I saw in this area before...=这里的草木都枯萎了？明明以前的魔物只有史莱姆...
I sense a Drain Crystal ahead of us. Let's find it and destroy it.=前面感觉到黑暗水晶的邪恶波动。找到后摧毁它吧。

Be careful when you're close to walls or when you're in narrow places like between pillars. Sometimes your sword will get stuck.=当你靠近墙壁或柱子之间的狭窄地方时要小心。请注意剑会被卡住。
I think this weapon is too big for me. It's kinda hard to wield... I wish God had given me a smaller, cuter weapon...=这把剑对我来说很难驾驭...如果神把它变成更小更可爱的武器就好了...
That might be enough for defeating slimes and goblins, but you'll need a sword this large to fight against big, strong monsters like golems.=史莱姆或者哥布林那种程度还好说，如果是石像鬼那样强大、坚韧的魔物，这样大的剑是非常有必要的。

You want to make a wound you can use to transfer holy power into them with your blade. If you attack the inside of the body directly like that, you can destroy any monster.=从剑身灌注的神圣之力可以用斩击造成大量伤害。能直接攻击魔物的内部，消灭各种魔物。
Huh... That's pretty...brutal...=呵呵...那挺...野蛮的哈...
Um... Iris... Why do you think the goblins kidnapped my sister?=嗯...Iris...为什么哥布林会抓走姐姐呢？
Well, what does your sister look like?=...你姐姐长得怎么样？
What does she look like...? She... Miria has...=姐姐的样子…？姐姐... Miria姐姐她...
Your weapon has been infused with Ice magic=你的武器已经融入了冰魔法
We both have the same hair and eye color, but she braids her hair in the back... And she ties it with the same kind of ribbon as me - the blue one Polon picked up earlier.=眼睛的颜色与我一样，头发也一样，只是在后面有三条辫子...就用这个Polon捡到的缎带绑在了一起。
Do you two have similar faces and figures?=...脸和身材也和你相似吗？
I guess you could say so... But Miria is taller and bustier. The men around her are always staring at her breasts...=样子的话大家都说很像...但是Miria姐姐的个子很高，身材也很好。男人们也总是盯着姐姐的胸部看...
Does she wear any accessories?=身上有什么首饰之类的东西？
Accessories...? No, she doesn't usually... Oh, actually, she was wearing the pink gem necklace I gave her the other day...=首饰？姐姐不太喜欢那样的东西...说起来，可能是戴了上次送的粉红宝石项链…
Pink, huh...? If it was a reddish color, it's possible... But why...?=粉红色的宝石...？如果是类似红色的话就有可能...但为什么...？
...I'm sorry. I don't know why your sister was taken.=...对不起，我也不知道你的姐姐为什么被抓走。
Oh... Okay...=嗯啊...是吗...
If you break Drain Crystals like this, it should reduce the number of monsters, too.=如果你像这样打破〖黑暗水晶〗，应该能减少怪物的数量。
Okay... Phew... I have to hurry and find Miria...=好的...呼呼...我必须赶紧找到Miria ...
Nnn... Haa... Haaa... Ngh... Haa... Haah...=嗯...哈哈...哈...唔嗯... 哈...哈哈...
You seem quite worn out. We should stop here and take a break.=你好像消耗了很多体力，差不多该停下来休息了。
B-But... My sister... I have to hurry...!=B-ant，但...我的姐姐...我必须赶紧...！
Just listen to me. Stop moving and rest.=听我说，停下来休息。
I-I don't wanna... We don't know what the goblins could be doing to her...!=但、但是因为哥布林它们会对姐姐...！
...I said, "stop"!=...我说“停下”！
Whoa, you appeared out of nowhere... Eeeek!=啊，你从哪里冒出来的...
Huh...? Haa, haa... My form... I returned...to normal...=咦...？ 哈，哈...为什么…身体…又恢复原状了…
I lifted the transformation.=我解除了变身。
Ngh... Haa... Why...?=嗯...哈哈...为什么...？
You know you've been running around and fighting in your holy knight form since we lift the village, right?=你离开村子后一直以圣骑士的姿态战斗赶路吧？
Haa... Haa... I know... So what...?=哈哈...哈哈...我知道...所以...？
This magic item I gave you... The holy knight's brooch uses the wearer's magic to draw out holy power from the earth and sky.=这个魔导具...圣骑士的胸针使用佩戴者的魔力，从大地与空气中提取神圣的力量。
In other words, this brooch is the source of the holy power used to defeat demons. It's a very precious item, so handle it with care, okay?=换句话说，这个胸针是打倒魔物的神圣力量的来源。这是一个非常珍贵的东西，所以不能随意对待。
O-Okay... Huff... Haa... So... What then...?=嗯嗯...呼...哈...那个...然后...？
The brooch uses the magic within you to fuel holy knight powers. To put it another way, every time you wield the holy knight's power, it chips away at your own magic.=胸针将你自身的魔力作为燃料，将魔力转化为圣骑士的力量。反过来说，作为圣骑士每次施展力量，你都会消耗魔力。
When you run out of magic energy, you lose your holy knight abilities. I don't expect that you will exhaust your magic, as long as you don't use it recklessly or over a long period of time.=魔力耗尽的话就无法使用能力了。不过，不长时间使用的话，就不会消耗怎么多魔力吧
Okay... I see... Thanks...for telling me that...=好的...我明白了...谢谢你...告诉我...
You seem to have as much magic as any regular human... It's clear to me that you're running low on both magic and stamina from your unsteady feet.=你现在的魔力就和普通人差不多...现在看来只是魔力和体力都用尽了，才变得摇摇晃晃的样子。
That's why you should rest in your normal form and restore your magic.=还是这样休息一下吧，等魔力恢复为好。
But... I have to get to my sister...=但是...我必须快些找回我的姐姐...
Do you really want to barge into a horde of monsters in that form? We don't even know what kinds of monsters are waiting for us ahead.=你打算就这样冲进魔物群？？不知道会有什么样的魔物会等着你呢。
But... The goblins took my sister... They could be doing awful things to her as we speak...!=但是...哥布林姐姐了我的妹妹...就在我们说话时，他们可以对她做出可怕的事情...！
I understand that you're worried, but if they're intending to rape her, she probably won't be killed. Besides...=我晓得你担心，但如果他们打算强奸她，她可能不会被杀。除此之外...
R-Rape...!? My sister...!? No, I can't let that happen...!=强、强奸...！？我的姐姐...！？不，我不能让这种情况发生...！
Let me finish! I think those goblins kidnapped your sister for a different purpose.=请听我把话说完！我认为那些哥布林把你姐姐抓走，另有目的。
Think about it. They even brought a golem to attack the village. If they just wanted to kidnap a random human, it would have been easier to ambush one on the road.=想一想。他们甚至带来了攻击村庄的傀儡。想抓走人，还不如在必经之路上埋伏比较好。
Then why did they take away Miria...? My sister is... She's good at cooking and is a bit of a worrywart, but she's just a normal girl...=那他们为什么带走Miria ...？我姐姐是...只是个会做饭又爱操心的普通人啊...
Your sister's a real beauty, right? Maybe they're going to give her to Archlich as a gift...=你的姐姐很漂亮吧？难道是要作为礼物送给大尸巫吗...
Whatever the reason, you need to rest now so you have the energy to catch up to them and find out.=嗯，为了追上它们找到原因，现在就需要休息。
Okay... I'll rest a little...=好的...我会休息一下...
Good. You really need the break.=嗯，那我们休息一下吧。
Well then... Heehee... If that's settled, we'd better prepare.=那么... 呵呵...决定了的话，就准备下吧。
First, go collect some branches we can use for firewood. By the time you're done with that, you should have recovered some magic. Then transform again, beat a slime and hell beetle, and bring them over here.=先收集树枝作为篝火，之后魔力会稍微恢复。你就再一次变身，打倒史莱姆和地狱甲虫，把它们搬过来。
Oh, but don't use your sword. The holy powers will immediately turn the corpse into Magic Stones, so punch them and knock them out instead. Hehe... Once you're done with all that, you can go to sleep.=但不要用你的剑。神圣的力量立即会将尸体转变为魔法石，所以打晕它们就好了。呵呵...等结束了，再睡一会吧。
(<indent%3D0.4em>Ugh, Iris... For someone who told me to rest, she sure works me hard... She's not gentle, and she's sort of scary. She's not like how I imagined fairies to be...)=(<indent%3D0.4em>呃，Iris...都说让我休息了，还让我乱来...她不温柔，总感觉她有点可怕。和我想像中的仙女有些不一样啊...）
...ngh...... Nnnm...=...嗯... 嗯嘛...
Huh...? Why am I...?=哎...？为什么我...？
I asked Iris to keep watch...and laid down on the grass...=我让Iris放哨...然后睡在了草地上...
Iris, how long was I sleeping?=Iris，我睡了多久了？
Iris...?=Iris...？
Is this...my house...?=这是...我的家...？
But the village... I thought it was destroyed by monsters... And God made me a holy knight...=但村...村子被魔物袭击了...我成为了神的骑士...
Maybe...it really was all a dream... Even Iris...and the monsters...=也许...这真的是梦...甚至Iris...怪物...都是梦...
Just a fairy tale...=只是一个童话故事...
Th-Then... Miria! Miria must be here!=那么，那么...Miria！姐姐在哪里！
Ah! Miria...=啊! Miria ...
Hey, Miria! I... I just had the scariest dream...=啊，Miria！我...我刚才做了个可怕的梦...
That pot...=那锅...
Heehee... So you did make tomato soup after all!=呵呵...所以你果然把西红柿做成了汤啊！
No... Heeheehee... This soup is full of...meat... It's...meat soup...=不...呵呵呵...这汤满是...肉...它是...肉汤...
Wh-What was that, Miria...? I couldn't hear you well... What kind of meat? Is it lamb again...?=那，那是什么，Miria...？我听不清楚你的声音...哪种肉？是羔羊吗？
No... Today's meat is... Khehehehe...=不...今天的肉是...啧啧啧...
Eeeek...!=啊啊啊...！
Ah... No... Why...?=啊...不...为什么...？
Woman... Rape...! Rape...and kill...! Khehehe, kill and rape!=女人...强奸...！强奸...并杀死...！ 啧啧啧，杀死和强奸！
N-No... Ack... Aaah...=不，不...啊唔...啊...
Aah...ah... That's right...=啊...啊...那是对的...
I-I was...chosen to be a holy knight by God... I can...defeat these goblins...=我，我...被选为上帝的圣骑士...我可以...击败这些哥布林...
Whatcha say!? Khehehe!=你说什么！？ 嗝呵呵！
No... That was a dream... I have to...run...!=不...那是一个梦...我必须...跑...！
Khehe! Oh no, you don't!=呵呵！哦不，你没有！

Ghehe! I caught the woman! I'll share her with you guys, too!=嗝呵！我抓住了女人！我也会和你们分享她！
Heh heh heh! How thoughtful!=呵呵嘿！考虑周全！

Chapter 4    The Brooch of Sunlight=第4章阳光胸针
I see... So you lost both your parents... I'm sorry for bringing back sad memories.=我看到...所以你失去了你的父母...我很抱歉带回悲伤的回忆。
It's okay. I was little and I don't remember much about them, anyway. Besides, I've always had Miria around, so I wasn't lonely at all, and I had friends like Olivia and Polon to play with...=没关系。无论如何，我很少，我不记得他们。此外，我一直都在米里亚，所以我根本不是孤独，我有朋友喜欢奥利赛亚和Polon玩...
Heehee... What about your family, Iris? Do you have any siblings? Or are fairies born from flowers?=heehee ...你的家人怎么样？你有兄弟姐妹吗？或者是从鲜花出生的仙女？
What, flowers? Heehee, of course not. We're born from our mothers, just like humans.=什么，鲜花？嘿，当然不是。我们来自母亲的出生，就像人类一样。
My parents and grandparents should be doing well in the neighboring village, but I've been so busy with serving God, I haven't had the chance to visit them lately.=我的父母和祖父母应该在邻近的村庄做得很好，但我一直忙于服侍上帝，我没有机会最近去参观他们。
Oh... And I have a younger brother...=哦...我有一个弟弟...
Younger brother?=弟弟？
Yes, he's around the same age as you...=是的，他在同龄相同的时候...
Hmm... A boy fairy, huh? Do all fairies look like you, Iris?=嗯...一个男孩仙女，呵呵？所有仙女都看起来像你，♥？
I suppose so...=我想是这样...
Heehee, if he's your brother, he must be handsome! Or maybe he's the cute type since he's small and has wings. That's so nice...=Heehee，如果他是你的兄弟，他一定是英俊的！或者他是他很小的可爱类型，并且有翅膀。那太好了...
...It isn't. Anyway, that human soldier said something about a settlement in the forest. Do you think it's far from here?=...不是。无论如何，人类士兵在森林中说了一些关于森林的解决方案。你觉得它远非在这里吗？
Huh...? Yeah, I think it'll take us about half a day to get there. Oh, but if I head there in my holy knight form, we might get there sooner. I can run much faster when I transform.=呵呵...？是的，我认为它会带我们大约半天到达那里。哦，但如果我在我的♥形式上，我们可能会迟早到达那里。当我转换时，我可以更快地跑得更快。
Hehe, then you could run even faster without armor. It seems like this area doesn't have strong monsters. It should be no problem if you're lightly dressed.=呵呵，那么你可以在没有装甲的情况下更快地运行。这似乎这个地区没有强壮的怪物。如果你轻轻地穿着，它应该没问题。
What? So you want me to take off the armor after I transform into a knight? But that armor's white and shiny. It must be expensive...=什么？所以你想让我在改变骑士后脱掉盔甲？但那个盔甲的白色和闪亮。它必须昂贵...
Teehee... No, you just have to transform into a holy knight without forming the armor.=Teehee ...不，你只需要转变为一个没有形成盔甲的♥。
When you transform with the brooch, imagine yourself only wearing the blue dress. You should be able to transform based on that mental image.=当你用胸针转换时，想象自己只穿着蓝色的衣服。您应该能够基于该心理图像进行转换。
Wow, I didn't know I could that! This brooch is amazing.=哇，我不知道我可以！这个胸针很棒。
Huh...? If I can transform into whatever I imagine, does that mean I can change into other forms?=呵呵...？如果我可以转换为我想象的，这是否意味着我可以改为其他形式？
Now you're getting it, heehee... If you can imagine it, you can change not just your clothes, but your face and body, even the color of your skin.=现在你已经得到了它，heehee ...如果你能想象它，你就可以改变你的衣服，而是你的脸和身体，甚至是你皮肤的颜色。
Even my face and body...? Wow... Oh, is that the reason why my breasts get a little bigger when I transform...?=甚至是我的脸和身体...？哇...哦，这是我转换时我的乳房变得更大的原因...？
Teehee... That must be your ideal form.=Teehee ...这一定是你理想的形式。
When you transform into a different outfit for the first time, you'll have to consume a lot of magic to make the outfit from scratch. Just like strengthening your abilities, you'll need to collect a lot of Magic Stones to do this.=当你第一次转变为不同的装备时，你必须消耗很多魔法来从头开始制作衣服。就像加强你的能力一样，你需要收集很多魔石来做这件事。
The holy knight's armor and gauntlets provide great defense thanks to their divine protection, but they're a little heavy.=由于他们的神圣保护，圣骑士的盔甲和手持式提供了很大的防守，但它们是一个很重的沉重。
When you're traveling a long distance or dealing with a fast monster, you might want to change into your lightweight form.=当您旅行长途或处理快速怪物时，您可能希望改为您的轻量级形式。

A girl who lives in a mountain village. While her lifestyle may not be extravagant, she and her older sister, Miria, live together happily with the help of their fellow villagers. She usually either works as a clerk at her village's general store or gathers herbs in the mountains. She often argues with her older sister who still treats her like a child, but deep down she really loves her. \r\nTravelers often come in search of food or lodging from a large mountain road that runs near the village. The village youngsters tend to listen closely to the words of travelers and long for the world outside the village, but Ricca is generally uninterested and prefers to take things at her own pace.=A girl who lives in a mountain village.

The most beautiful girl in the village and Ricca's gentle older sister. She is 10 years older than Ricca and usually works in the cafeteria. After losing their parents to an epidemic, she did everything in her power to raise Ricca, who was still a child. She has since mellowed out, but she used to be very emotional, shy and had a very strong sense of duty. \r\nLegends of a fallen kingdom have been passed down by refugees for hundreds of years. A rundown church from that time still stands within the village. The church is still used to this day. Miria currently cleans and manages it in place of the elderly village mayor and his wife.=The most beautiful girl in the village and Ricca's gentle older sister.

The form taken by Ricca after transforming using the power of the brooch given to her by "God." \r\nThrough divine magical protection, Ricca's soft, light body now contains strength on par with a muscular adult male. Her endurance and recovery capabilities have also improved drastically. \r\nRicca's sun-shaped brooch is enchanted with a variety of spells. It enhances Ricca's abilities by absorbing magic, allowing her to fight against monsters on a more equal footing.=The form taken by Ricca after transforming using the power of the brooch given to her by "God." \r\nThrough divine magical protection, Ricca's soft, light body now contains strength on par with a muscular adult male.

The form taken by Ricca after fully drawing out the latent holy knight energy contained within her brooch by combining the magic of humans, monsters and darkness. Due to the tremendous magic expenditure of this form, it may be difficult for the newly-transformed Ricca to handle, but if she were to obtain complete control over it, her power could exceed even that of a god.=The form taken by Ricca after fully drawing out the latent holy knight energy contained within her brooch by combining the magic of humans, monsters and darkness.

A fairy who traveled from the high mountains in search of the one chosen to be the holy knight. A mystic who uses restorative and illusion magic to aid her allies in combat. \r\nBecause she was still relatively young amongst fairy kind, whose lifespans far exceed those of humans, it was believed she would be capable of adapting to the world of humans. Thus she was given the mission of providing support for the holy knight by "God". \r\nDespite being a kind girl who cares for her friends at heart, the importance of her mission weighs heavily on her shoulders, often causing her expression to grow stern.=A fairy who traveled from the high mountains in search of the one chosen to be the holy knight.

A mage girl who saved Ricca when she was being attacked by orcs. Polite and diligent. In order to focus on her magic research she currently lives in isolation, away from villages and towns. She feels lonely because she doesn't have any friends. Her parents are both renowned mages - her father specializing in restorative magic and her mother in attack magic. Claret herself received special education from a young age and is able to use a wide variety of magic. Her parents were summoned to the capital in an effort to deal with the monster problem, so Claret currently lives alone, protecting her isolated home while eliminating nearby monsters.=A mage girl who saved Ricca when she was being attacked by orcs.

A sheepdog that was raised in Ricca's village. Because herding was handled by his brothers and due to the increasing number of monsters around the village, he was allowed to roam free, acting as a guard dog. \r\nClever, and friendly to humans, he has been Ricca's closest playmate ever since the blacksmith's daughter, Olivia, left the village.=A sheepdog that was raised in Ricca's village.

A servant created by an evil necromancer who fitted a puppet made of soil and stone with a core crystal containing the soul of an unknown entity. Is loyal to its master's will and possesses immensely powerful arms. \r\nEven for a holy knight whose body is stronger than that of a normal human, escaping from its sturdy arms would prove difficult. Those taken captive would find escape difficult; their vain struggles would only exhaust them and ultimately hasten their conveyance to the golem's master. Even so, if the captured prey insisted on maintaining its resistance, then...=A servant created by an evil necromancer who fitted a puppet made of soil and stone with a core crystal containing the soul of an unknown entity.

The form taken by the goblin captain of the forest fortress after being empowered by the evil magic emitted from the black crystal ball. Highly intelligent for a goblin and a formerly loyal subject of Archlich, but deemed to be of no further use after luring Ricca to the fortress. \r\nHaving become part-undead through dark magic, he's bigger and stronger than a normal goblin, but weaker to flames. He possesses a powerful spinning attack, but if you make use of the chains hanging in the fortress, it should be easy to avoid.=The form taken by the goblin captain of the forest fortress after being empowered by the evil magic emitted from the black crystal ball.

An undead born from the fusion of a drain crystal's magic and human enmity. The spitting image of what humans regard to be a "grim reaper". Possesses no physical form since its body is composed of magic. \r\nA holy knight's weapon has the special ability to deal with enemies without losing its holy energy. Enemies hit by its blade will have their wounds filled with holy energy and take fatal damage, but because this monster doesn't possess a physical form, even a holy knight's weapon won't be able to deal any effective damage.=An undead born from the fusion of a drain crystal's magic and human enmity.

A female Demon who feeds on the semen of humans and demi-humans. In order to capture the holy knight girl, Miria's body was modified by Archlich's spells. She's been given a lightning attack that can pierce through holy protection as well as a magic eye that can seduce its target regardless of gender. Miria's sense of right and wrong have been overwritten to suit her monstrous form. With the desires she had kept hidden deep inside her amplified, the kind personality Miria used to have has been warped beyond recognition.=A female Demon who feeds on the semen of humans and demi-humans.

A half-beast, half-Demon who possesses both a limitless supply of magic and an intellect high enough to understand human language. The beast that appeared in front of Ricca's party was one that had made a connection with a mage girl 60 years ago. From that experience, it began to hunt monsters and soon came to be worshipped as a guardian by humans in the surrounding lands. After its mind was polluted by evil energy, it began to shut itself away in its lair. It now protects the drain crystal that absorbs the overflowing earth magic from in the valley.=A half-beast, half-Demon who possesses both a limitless supply of magic and an intellect high enough to understand human language.

An undead that was revived when Archlich poured his magic energy into the corpse of an elite guard. Possesses intelligence on par with what it had before revival. Because it is controlled through magic rather than its own heavy muscles, the attacks its old bones makes are more precise than they were in life. \r\nDifficult to deal with because it wields a spear with a long reach, but if you can avoid the spear's tip, you may find an opportunity to strike. \r\nHaving lost its meat rod and means of release after becoming a skeleton, its pent-up desires have become deviously twisted.=An undead that was revived when Archlich poured his magic energy into the corpse of an elite guard.

A survivor of the giant beings once worshipped as gods of the sea. Having lost devotees due to the ascendancy of the sun god, it was driven from its home, and has since lived quietly in a cave at the bottom of the ocean. Despite gradually being forgotten, by performing good deeds such as freeing ships stuck in coral reefs in the nearby seas, it continued to try to live an existence beneficial to humans. However, after being exposed to the effects of evil magic, it turned into a monster and became Archlich's servant. Since becoming a monster, it has guarded the cave that leads to the castle. \r\nIn order to maintain its massive body, it uses an external magical core that it has taken into its body. This core was once given as an offering by believers, but...=A survivor of the giant beings once worshipped as gods of the sea.

A Demonic beast created by a lich by patching various parts of monsters and animals together. Possesses the ability to use its tentacle-shaped tail to stab and inject enemies that invade its territory with cursed, petrifying poison. \r\nThanks to holy energy, the holy knight possesses a high resistance to physical maladies. However, if enough petrifying poison to exceed said resistance were injected at once, there would be no stopping their body from turning to stone.=A Demonic beast created by a lich by patching various parts of monsters and animals together.

The leader of the arachne tribe that inhabits the northern lands. Because of a high magic affinity and therefore resistance, it isn't affected by the evil magic infecting the lands. However, to protect the northern lands for its comrades, it willingly became a subordinate of the Archlich. \r\nPossesses a large, powerful body which has adapted to better maintain its body heat in harsh environments. Despite having lost its ability to shoot webs, it can instead control ice magic to freeze and capture its prey.=The leader of the arachne tribe that inhabits the northern lands.

A ghoul created by a lich by pouring his evil magic into the corpse of an orc. With empowered endurance and regenerative abilities, any damage taken from a half-hearted attack will be instantly restored. Because its body size and weight have increased, each step it takes causes small tremors in its vicinity. It wields a war hammer infused with lightning magic, but unlike the succubus', this magic doesn't have any special properties.=A ghoul created by a lich by pouring his evil magic into the corpse of an orc.

A subspecies of wyvern born from a sudden mutation caused by waves that traveled through a gate from the world of darkness. \r\nIt can use magic to spew lava, but because its intelligence is so low, it will most likely hit both its prey and itself. The blood it sprays from its mouth contains a curse that decreases the defense of its target.=A subspecies of wyvern born from a sudden mutation caused by waves that traveled through a gate from the world of darkness. \r\nIt can use magic to spew lava, but because its intelligence is so low, it will most likely hit both its prey and itself.

Leader of the liches and the one responsible for placing the drain crystals across the lands. The principle force behind the monsters' increased aggressiveness. Dark energy consistently emanates from his body, and he can use a limitless amount of high level magic. \r\nDespite being a spellcaster, he is equipped with a sword and armor, allowing him to adequately engage in close combat as well.=Leader of the liches and the one responsible for placing the drain crystals across the lands.

The form taken by the court magician who was once in an illicit relationship with the queen of the island castle, after taking over and modifying the body of one of the queen's royal guards. \r\nHe planned to usurp the throne in an attempt to prove his worthiness to the woman he loved, but as far as the queen was concerned he was merely one of her many lovers. His ambitions grew beyond his stature, and after sullying his hands with illegal necromancy, he was soon reported to the authorities and dragged to the execution grounds. In the moment of his death, he completed a spell to steal the lives of all the residents on the island, and was reborn as an undead. He used monsters to rule the surrounding regions but was unable to obtain his revenge against the queen. \r\nIn order to fulfill his ambitions and find the queen, he continued to expand his territories before being eliminated by a female knight wielding the power of the sun.=The form taken by the court magician who was once in an illicit relationship with the queen of the island castle, after taking over and modifying the body of one of the queen's royal guards. \r\nHe planned to usurp the throne in an attempt to prove his worthiness to the woman he loved, but as far as the queen was concerned he was merely one of her many lovers.

The descendent of a primal dragon that the previous holy knight sealed away in another world. The injuries from its previous battle still haven't healed so there are open wounds covering its body. Despite possessing a large body and enormous magical power, its intelligence is lacking, which is why it only attempts to devour whatever lies before it. However, its gluttony knows no bounds, it is capable of eradicating all creatures inhabiting an entire continents within a few weeks. \r\nLong ago, the being known as "God" amongst humans and fairies used sunlight to banish the dragon tribe that lives in darkness from the land's surface. The power of the holy knight, which unleashes the same dazzling sunlight, is a power meant to seal away monsters just like this.=The descendent of a primal dragon that the previous holy knight sealed away in another world.

An illusion created in a dream by Archlich in order to take over Ricca's body. Archlich attempted to engrave a crippling weakness to sexual desire into Ricca's heart and exhaust her mentally, before stealing control of her body. The after-effects of battle that flare up nearly every night for Ricca are by and large due to Archlich's interference. Archlich had originally planned to steal Ricca's body, research the dredges of holy energy within it and use his findings to formulate a plan to deal with the next holy knight that appeared.=An illusion created in a dream by Archlich in order to take over Ricca's body.
